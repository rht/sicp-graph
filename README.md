# SICP-Graph

This project began from a question "can machines understand the text within SICP?".


A graph visualization of the interconnectedness between the sections in SICP.

Directory tree structure:
- `docs` contains all the data and the static pages rendered on gh-pages
- `texts` contains the cleaned html and markdown version of each texts

The graph visualization has since been extended to other texts:
- [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://rht.github.io/sicp-graph)
- [Structure and Interpretation of Classical Mechanics](https://rht.github.io/sicp-graph/index.html?type=sicm)
   * Lagrangian mechanics is more related to rigid bodies than Hamiltonian mechanics.
- The Principles of Quantum Mechanics: [chapters](https://rht.github.io/sicp-graph/index.html?type=dirac),
  [sections](https://rht.github.io/sicp-graph/index.html?type=dirac_sections)
- [The Society of Mind](https://rht.github.io/sicp-graph/index.html?type=som). Sourced From http://www.aurellem.org/minsky/
  * Each sections are highly correlated with each other
