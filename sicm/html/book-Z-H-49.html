<h2><a href="book-Z-H-4.html#%_toc_%_sec_4.1">4.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Emergence of the Divided Phase Space</a></h2>
<p>
<a name="%_idx_2136"></a><a name="%_idx_2138"></a>
We can get some insight into these qualitative changes of behavior by
considering systems in which the additional effects are turned on by
varying a parameter.  For some value of the parameter the system has 
enough conserved quantities to be reducible to
quadratures; as we vary the parameter away from this value we can
study how the divided phase space appears.  The <a name="%_idx_2140"></a>driven pendulum offers an
archetypal example of such a system.  If the amplitude of the drive
is zero, then solutions of the driven pendulum are the same as the
solutions of the undriven pendulum.  We have seen surfaces of section
for the strongly driven pendulum, illustrating the divided phase space.
Here we crank up the drive slowly and study how the phase portrait
changes.  </p>
<p>
<a name="%_idx_2142"></a><a name="%_idx_2144"></a>The motion of the driven pendulum with zero-amplitude drive is the
<a name="%_idx_2146"></a><a name="%_idx_2148"></a><a name="%_idx_2150"></a>same as that of an undriven pendulum.  The motion of a pendulum was
described in section&nbsp;<a href="book-Z-H-39.html#%_sec_3.3">3.3</a>.  Energy is
conserved, so all orbits are level curves of the Hamiltonian in the
phase plane (see figure&nbsp;<a href="#FIGURE_4.1">4.1</a>).  There are three
regions of the phase plane that have qualitatively different types of
motion: the region in which the pendulum oscillates, the region in
which the pendulum circulates in one direction, and the region of
circulation in the other direction.  In the center of the oscillation
region there is a <a name="%_idx_2152"></a>stable equilibrium, at which the pendulum is hanging
<a name="%_idx_2154"></a>motionless.  At the boundaries between these regions the pendulum is
<a name="%_idx_2156"></a><a name="%_idx_2158"></a>asymptotic to the unstable equilibrium, at which the pendulum is
standing upright. There are two asymptotic trajectories,
corresponding to the two ways the equilibrium can be approached.  Each
of these is also asymptotic to the unstable equilibrium going backward
in time.</p>

<h4><a href="book-Z-H-4.html#%_toc_%_sec_Temp_295">Driven pendulum sections with zero drive</a></h4>
<p><a name="%_idx_2160"></a><a name="%_idx_2162"></a>
Now consider the periodically driven pendulum, but with zero-amplitude
drive.  The state of the driven pendulum is specified by an angle
coordinate, its conjugate momentum, and the phase of the periodic
drive.  With zero-amplitude drive the evolution of the ``driven'' pendulum
is the same as the undriven pendulum.  The phase of the drive does not
affect the evolution, but we consider the phase of the drive as part
of the state so we can give a uniform description that allows us to
include the zero-amplitude drive case with the nonzero-amplitude
case.</p>
<p>
For the driven pendulum we make stroboscopic surfaces of section by
sampling the state at the drive period and plotting the angular
momentum versus the angle (see figure&nbsp;<a href="#FIGURE_4.2">4.2</a>).  For
zero-amplitude drive, the section points are confined to the curves
traced by trajectories of the undriven pendulum.  For each kind of
orbit that we saw in the one-degree-of-freedom problem, there are
orbits of the driven pendulum that generate a corresponding pattern of
points on the section.</p>
<p>
<a name="FIGURE_4.2"></a></p>
<div align=left><img src="chap4-Z-G-2.gif" border="0"></div>
<p></p>
<p>
The two stationary orbits at the equilibrium points of the pendulum
appear as points on the surface of section.  Equilibrium points are
fixed points of the Poincar&eacute; map.</p>
<p>
Section points for the oscillating orbits of the pendulum fall on the
corresponding contour of the Hamiltonian.  Section points for the
circulating orbits of the pendulum are likewise confined to the
corresponding contour of the Hamiltonian.  We notice that the
appearance of the points generated by orbits on different contours is
different.  Typically, if we collected more points on the surface of
section the points would eventually fill in the contours.  However,
there are actually two possibilities.  Remember that the period of the
pendulum is different for different trajectories.  If the period of the
pendulum is <a name="%_idx_2164"></a>commensurate with the period of the drive, then only a
finite number of points will appear on the section.  Two periods are
commensurate if one is a rational multiple of the other.  If the two
periods are incommensurate then the section points never repeat.  In
fact, the points fill the contour densely, coming arbitrarily close to
every point on the contour.</p>
<p>
Section points for the asymptotic trajectories of the pendulum fall on
the contour of the Hamiltonian containing the saddle point.  Each
asymptotic orbit generates a sequence of isolated points that
accumulate near the fixed point.  No individual orbit fills the
separatrix on the section.</p>
<p>
<a name="FIGURE_4.3"></a></p>

<a name="%_sec_Temp_296"></a>
<h4><a href="book-Z-H-4.html#%_toc_%_sec_Temp_296">Driven pendulum sections for small drive</a></h4>
<p>Now consider the surface of section for small-amplitude drive (see
figure&nbsp;<a href="#FIGURE_4.3">4.3</a>).  The amplitude of the drive is 
<em>A</em> = 0.001&nbsp;m; the drive frequency is 4.2 <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-23.gif" border="0"><sub>0</sub>, where
<img src="chap1-Z-G-D-23.gif" border="0"><sub>0</sub>  =  (<em>g</em>/<em>l</em>)<sup>1/2</sup>.
The overall appearance of the
surface of section is similar to the section with zero-amplitude
drive.  Many orbits appear to lie on invariant curves similar to
the invariant curves of the zero-drive case.  However, there are
several new features.</p>
<p>
There are now resonance regions that correspond to the pendulum
rotating in lock with the drive.  These features are found in the
upper and lower circulating region of the surface of section.  Each
<a name="%_idx_2166"></a><a name="%_idx_2168"></a>island has a fixed point for which the pendulum rotates exactly once
per cycle of the drive.  In general, fixed points on the surface of
section correspond to periodic motions of the system in the full phase
space.  The fixed point is at &plusmn; <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-15.gif" border="0">, indicating that the pendulum
is vertical at the section phase of the drive.  For orbits in the
resonance region away from the fixed point the points on the section
apparently generate curves that surround the fixed point.<a name="call_footnote_Temp_297" href="#footnote_Temp_297"><sup><small>1</small></sup></a>  For these orbits
the pendulum rotates on average once per drive, but the phase of the
pendulum is sometimes ahead of the drive and sometimes behind it.</p>
<p>
There are other islands that appear with nonzero-amplitude drive.  In
the central oscillation region there is a sixfold chain of <a name="%_idx_2170"></a>secondary
islands.  For this orbit the pendulum is oscillating, and the period
of the oscillation is <a name="%_idx_2172"></a>commensurate with the drive.  The six islands
are all generated by a single orbit.  In fact, the islands are visited
successively in a clockwise direction.  After six cycles of the drive
the section point returns to the same island but falls at a different
point on the island curve, accumulating the island curve after many
iterations.  The motion of the pendulum is not periodic, but is
locked in a resonance so that on average it oscillates once for every
six cycles of the drive.</p>
<p>
Another feature that appears is a narrow chaotic region near where
the separatrix was in the zero-amplitude drive pendulum.  We find that
chaotic behavior typically makes its most prominent appearance near
separatrices.  This is not surprising because the difference in
velocities that distinguish whether the pendulum rotates or oscillates
is small for orbits near the <a name="%_idx_2174"></a><a name="%_idx_2176"></a>separatrix.  As the pendulum approaches
the top, whether it receives the extra nudge it needs to go over the
top depends on the phase of the drive.</p>
<p>
Actually, the apparent separatrices of the resonance islands for which
the pendulum period is equal to the drive period are each generated by
a chaotic orbit.  To see that this orbit appears to occupy an area one
would have to magnify the picture by about a factor of 10<sup>4</sup>.</p>
<p>
As the drive amplitude is increased the main qualitative changes are
the appearance of resonance islands and chaotic zones.  Some
qualitative characteristics of the zero case remain.  For
instance, many orbits appear to lie on invariant curves.  This behavior
is not peculiar to the driven pendulum; similar features quite
generally arise as additional effects are added to problems that are
reducible to quadratures.  This chapter is devoted to understanding in
greater detail how these generic features arise.</p>
