Numerical experiments are just what their name implies: experiments.
In describing and evaluating them, one should enter the state of mind
of the experimental physicist, rather than that of the mathematician.
Numerical experiments cannot be used to prove theorems; but, from the
physicist's point of view, they do often provide convincing evidence
for the existence of a phenomenon.  We will therefore follow an
informal, descriptive and non-rigorous approach.  Briefly stated, our
aim will be to <em>understand</em> the fundamental properties of dynamical
systems rather than to <em>prove</em> them.</p>

The formulation of mechanics with generalized coordinates and momenta
as dynamical state variables is called the Hamiltonian formulation.
The Hamiltonian formulation<a name="%_idx_1544"></a> of mechanics is equivalent to the
<a name="%_idx_1546"></a>Lagrangian formulation; however, each presents a useful point of view.
The Lagrangian formulation is especially useful in the initial
formulation of a system.  The Hamiltonian formulation is especially
useful in understanding the evolution, especially when there are
symmetries and conserved quantities.</p>
<p>
<a name="%_idx_1548"></a>For each continuous symmetry of a mechanical system there is a
<a name="%_idx_1550"></a>conserved quantity.  If the generalized coordinates can be chosen to
reflect a symmetry, then, by the Lagrange equations, the conjugate
momentum is conserved.  We have seen that such conserved quantities
allow us to deduce important properties of the motion.  For instance,
consideration of the energy and angular momentum allowed us to deduce
that rotation of a free rigid body about the axis of intermediate
moment of inertia is unstable, and that rotation about the other
principal axes is stable.  For the axisymmetric top, we used two
conserved momenta to reexpress the equations governing the evolution
of the tilt angle so that they involve only the tilt angle and its
derivative.  The evolution of the tilt angle can be determined
independently and has simply periodic solutions.  Consideration of the
conserved momenta has provided key insight.  The Hamiltonian
formulation is motivated by the desire to focus attention on the
momenta.</p>
<p>
In the Lagrangian formulation the momenta are, in a sense, secondary
quantities: the momenta are functions of the state space variables,
but the evolution of the state space variables depends on the state
space variables and not on the momenta.  To make use of any conserved
momenta requires fooling around with the specific equations.  The
momenta can be rewritten in terms of the coordinates and the
velocities, so, locally, we can solve for the velocities in terms of
the coordinates and momenta.  For a given mechanical system, and a
Lagrangian describing its dynamics in a given coordinate system,
the momenta and the velocities can be deduced from each
other.  Thus we can represent the dynamical <a name="%_idx_1552"></a>state of the system in
terms of the coordinates and momenta just as well as with the
coordinates and the velocities.  If we use the coordinates and momenta
to represent the state and write the associated state derivative in
terms of the coordinates and momenta, then we have a self-contained
system.  This formulation of the equations governing the evolution of
the system has the advantage that if some of the momenta are
conserved, the remaining equations are immediately simplified.</p>
<p>
The Lagrangian formulation of mechanics has provided the means to
investigate the motion of complicated mechanical systems.  We have
found that dynamical systems exhibit a bewildering variety of possible
motions.  The motion is sometimes rather simple and sometimes
very complicated.  Sometimes the evolution is very
sensitive to the initial conditions, and sometimes it is
not.  And sometimes there are orbits that maintain resonance
relationships with a drive.  Consider the <a name="%_idx_1554"></a>periodically driven
pendulum: it can behave more or less as an undriven
pendulum with extra wiggles, it can move in a strongly chaotic
manner, or it can move in resonance with the drive, oscillating once for
every two cycles of the drive or looping around once per drive cycle.
Or consider the Moon.  The Moon rotates synchronously with its orbital
motion, always pointing roughly the same face to the Earth.  However,
Mercury rotates three times every two times it circles the Sun, and
Hyperion rotates chaotically.</p>
<p>
How can we make sense of this?  How do
we put the possible motions of these systems in relation to one another?
What other motions are possible?  The Hamiltonian formulation
of dynamics gives us much more than the stated goal of expressing the
system derivative in terms of potentially conserved quantities.  The
Hamiltonian formulation provides a convenient framework in which the
possible motions may be placed and understood.  We will be able to see
the range of stable resonance motions and the range of states reached
by chaotic trajectories, and discover other unsuspected possible
motions.  The Hamiltonian formulation leads to many additional
insights.</p>
