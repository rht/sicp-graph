<p>
There has been a remarkable revival of interest in classical mechanics
in recent years.  We now know that there is much more to classical
mechanics than previously suspected.  The behavior of classical
systems is surprisingly rich; derivation of the equations of motion,
the focus of traditional presentations of mechanics, is just the
beginning.  Classical systems display a complicated array of phenomena
such as nonlinear resonances, chaotic behavior, and transitions to
chaos.</p>
<p>
Traditional treatments of mechanics concentrate most of their effort
on the extremely small class of symbolically tractable dynamical
systems.  We concentrate on developing general methods for studying
the behavior of systems, whether or not they have a symbolic solution.
Typical systems exhibit behavior that is qualitatively different from
the solvable systems and surprisingly complicated.  We focus on the
phenomena of motion, and we make extensive use of computer simulation
to explore this motion.</p>
<p>
Even when a system is not symbolically tractable, the tools of
modern dynamics allow one to extract a qualitative understanding.
Rather than concentrating on symbolic descriptions, we concentrate on
geometric features of the set of possible trajectories.  Such tools
provide a basis for the systematic analysis of numerical or
experimental data.</p>
<p>
Classical mechanics is deceptively simple.  It is surprisingly easy to
get the right answer with fallacious reasoning or without real
understanding.  <a name="%_idx_4"></a><a name="%_idx_6"></a>Traditional mathematical notation contributes to this
problem.  Symbols have ambiguous meanings that depend on context,
and often even change within a given context.<a name="call_footnote_Temp_3" href="#footnote_Temp_3"><sup><small>1</small></sup></a>
<a name="%_idx_10"></a>For example, a fundamental
result of mechanics is the Lagrange equations.  In traditional
notation the Lagrange equations are written</p>
<p>
</p>
<div align=left><img src="front-Z-G-1.gif" border="0"></div>
<p> </p>
<p>
The Lagrangian <em>L</em> must be interpreted as a function of the position
and velocity components <em>q</em><sup><em>i</em></sup> and <img src="front-Z-G-D-1.gif" border="0"><sup><em>i</em></sup>, so that the partial
derivatives make sense, but then in order for the time derivative
<em>d</em>/<em>d</em><em>t</em> to make sense solution paths must have been inserted into the
partial derivatives of the Lagrangian to make functions of time.  The
traditional use of ambiguous notation is convenient in simple
situations, but in more complicated situations it can be a serious
handicap to clear reasoning.  In order that the reasoning be clear and
unambiguous, we have adopted a more precise mathematical notation.
Our notation is <a name="%_idx_12"></a><a name="%_idx_14"></a>functional and follows that of modern mathematical
presentations.<a name="call_footnote_Temp_4" href="#footnote_Temp_4"><sup><small>2</small></sup></a>
An introduction to our functional notation is in an appendix.
<p>
Computation also enters into the presentation of the mathematical
ideas underlying mechanics.  We require that our mathematical
notations be explicit and precise enough that they can be
interpreted automatically, as by a computer.  As a consequence of this
requirement the formulas and equations that appear in the text stand
on their own.  They have clear meaning, independent of the informal
context.  For example, we write Lagrange's equations in functional
notation as follows:<a name="call_footnote_Temp_5" href="#footnote_Temp_5"><sup><small>3</small></sup></a></p>
<p>
</p>
<div align=left><img src="front-Z-G-4.gif" border="0"></div>
<p></p>
<p>
The Lagrangian <em>L</em> is a real-valued function of time <em>t</em>, 
coordinates&nbsp;<em>x</em>, and velocities <em>v</em>; the value is <em>L</em>(<em>t</em>, <em>x</em>, <em>v</em>).  <a name="%_idx_20"></a><a name="%_idx_22"></a>Partial
derivatives are indicated as derivatives of functions with respect to
particular argument positions; <img src="front-Z-G-D-2.gif" border="0"><sub>2</sub> <em>L</em> indicates the function
obtained by taking the partial derivative of the Lagrangian function
<em>L</em> with respect to the velocity argument position.  The traditional
partial derivative notation, which employs a derivative with respect
to a ``variable,'' depends on context and can lead to ambiguity.<a name="call_footnote_Temp_6" href="#footnote_Temp_6"><sup><small>4</small></sup></a>
The partial derivatives of the Lagrangian are then explicitly evaluated
along a path function <em>q</em>.  The time derivative is taken and the
Lagrange equations formed.  Each step is explicit; there are no
implicit substitutions.</p>
<p>
Computational algorithms are used to communicate precisely some of the
methods used in the analysis of dynamical phenomena.  Expressing the
methods of variational mechanics in a computer language forces them to
be unambiguous and computationally effective.  Computation requires us
to be precise about the representation of mechanical and geometric
notions as computational objects and permits us to represent
explicitly the algorithms for manipulating these objects.  Also, once
formalized as a procedure, a mathematical idea becomes a tool that can
be used directly to compute results.</p>
<p>
Active exploration on the part of the student is an essential part of
the learning experience.  Our focus is on understanding the motion of
systems; to learn about motion the student must actively explore the
motion of systems through simulation and experiment.  The exercises
and projects are an integral part of the presentation.</p>
<p>
That the mathematics is precise enough to be interpreted automatically
allows active exploration to be extended to it.  The
requirement that the computer be able to interpret any expression
provides strict and immediate feedback as to whether the expression is
correctly formulated.  Experience demonstrates that interaction with
the computer in this way uncovers and corrects many deficiencies in
understanding.</p>
<p>
<a name="%_idx_26"></a>In this book we express computational methods in Scheme, a dialect of
the Lisp family of programming languages that we also use in our
introductory computer science subject at MIT.  There are many good
expositions of Scheme.  We provide a short introduction to Scheme in
an appendix.</p>
<p>
Even in the introductory computer science class we never formally
teach the language, because we do not have to.  We just use it, and
students pick it up in a few days.  This is one great advantage of
Lisp-like languages: They have very few ways of forming compound
expressions, and almost no syntactic structure.  All of the formal
properties can be covered in an hour, like the rules of chess.  After
a short time we forget about the syntactic details of the language
(because there are none) and get on with the real issues -- figuring
out what we want to compute.</p>
<p>
The advantage of Scheme over other languages for the exposition of
classical mechanics is that the manipulation of procedures that
implement mathematical functions is easier and more natural in Scheme
than in other computer languages.  Indeed, many theorems of mechanics
are directly representable as Scheme programs.   </p>
<p>
The version of Scheme that we use in this book is MIT Scheme,
augmented with a large library of software called <a name="%_idx_28"></a>Scmutils that
extends the Scheme operators to be generic over a variety of
mathematical objects, including symbolic expressions.  The Scmutils
library also provides support for the numerical methods we use in this
book, such as quadrature, integration of systems of differential
equations, and multivariate minimization.</p>
<p>
<a name="%_idx_30"></a><a name="%_idx_32"></a>The Scheme system, augmented with the Scmutils library, is free
software.  We provide this system, complete with documentation and
source code, in a form that can be used with the GNU/Linux operating
system, on the Internet at <br>
<a name="%_idx_34"></a><tt>http://www-mitpress.mit.edu/sicm</tt>.</p>
<p>
This book presents classical mechanics from an unusual perspective.
It focuses on understanding motion rather than deriving equations of
motion.  It weaves recent discoveries in nonlinear dynamics throughout
the presentation, rather than presenting them as an afterthought.  It
uses functional mathematical notation that allows precise
understanding of fundamental properties of classical mechanics.  It
uses computation to constrain notation, to capture and formalize
methods, for simulation, and for symbolic analysis.</p>
<p>
This book is the result of teaching classical mechanics at MIT for the
past six years.  The contents of our class began with ideas from a
class on nonlinear dynamics and solar system dynamics by Wisdom and
ideas about how computation can be used to formulate methodology
developed in an introductory computer science class by Abelson and
Sussman.  When we started we expected that using this approach to
formulate mechanics would be easy.  We quickly learned that
many things we thought we understood we did not in
fact understand.  Our requirement that our mathematical notations be
explicit and precise enough that they can be interpreted
automatically, as by a computer, is very effective in uncovering puns
and flaws in reasoning.  The resulting struggle to make the
mathematics precise, yet clear and computationally effective, lasted
far longer than we anticipated.  We learned a great deal about both
mechanics and computation by this process.  We hope others, especially
our competitors, will adopt these methods, which enhance understanding
while slowing research.</p>

<a name="%_idx_8"></a>  Hans Freudenthal argues 
that the reliance on
ambiguous, unstated notational conventions in such expressions as
<em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) and <em>d</em><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>)/<em>d</em><em>x</em> makes mathematics, and especially introductory
calculus, extremely confusing for beginning students; and he enjoins
mathematics educators to use more formal modern notation.</p>

<a name="%_idx_16"></a><a name="%_idx_18"></a>  Michael Spivak uses functional notation.  On p.&nbsp;44 he 
discusses some of the problems with classical notation.  We excerpt a
particularly juicy passage:
</p>
<blockquote>
The mere statement of [the chain rule] in classical
notation requires the introduction of irrelevant letters.  The usual
evaluation for <em>D</em><sub>1</sub>(<em>f</em><small>o</small>(<em>g</em>,<em>h</em>)) runs as follows:
<p>
If <em>f</em>(<em>u</em>,<em>v</em>) is a function and <em>u</em> = <em>g</em>(<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>) and <em>v</em> = <em>h</em>(<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>)
then

<em>f</em>(<em>g</em>(<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>),<em>h</em>(<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>)).]  This equation is often written simply
</p>
<div align=left><img src="front-Z-G-3.gif" border="0"></div>
<p> 
Note that <em>f</em> means something different on the two sides of the
equation!
