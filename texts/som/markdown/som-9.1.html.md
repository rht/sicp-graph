*9.1* wanting and liking
------------------------

One thing I hate is being asked questions like these:

Do you prefer physics to biology? Did you like that play? Do you like
Wagner? Did you enjoy your year abroad?

What makes us want to compress so much into such inexpressive summaries
as *like,* *prefer,* and *enjoy*? Why try to reduce such complex things
to simple values or amounts of pleasurable quality? The answer is that
our measures of pleasure have many uses. They help us make comparisons,
compromises, and choices. They are involved with the communication signs
that we use to signify various degrees of attachment, satisfaction, and
agreement. They show themselves not only in words, but also as gestures,
intonations, smiles and frowns, and many other expressive signs. But we
have to be careful not to accept those signs at their face value.
Neither the state of the world nor that of the mind is ever so simple
that it can be expressed in a single, one-dimensional judgment. No
situation is ever completely satisfactory or entirely disagreeable, and
our reactions of pleasure or disgust are only superficial summaries of
pyramids of underlying processes. To *enjoy* an experience, some of our
agents must summarize success — but other agents must be censuring their
subordinates for failing to achieve their goals. So we ought to be
suspicious when we find ourselves liking something very much, because
that might mean some of our agencies are forcefully suppressing other
possibilities.

The surer you are that you like what you are doing, the more completely
your other ambitions are being suppressed.

To choose between alternatives, the highest levels of the mind demand
the simplest summaries. If your top-level feelings were too often
*mixed,* you would rarely be able to make a choice to decide which foods
to eat, which paths to walk, or which thoughts to think. At the level of
action, you're forced to simplify right down to expressions like *Yes*
and *No.* But these are not informative enough to serve the lower levels
of the mind, where many processes go on at once, and every agent has to
judge how well it is serving some local goals. At lower levels of the
mind, there must be hosts of smaller, coexisting satisfactions and
annoyances.

We often talk as though we ought to be controlled by what we want.
Indeed we scarcely distinguish between wanting something and potentially
obtaining pleasure from it; the relation between these two ideas seems
so intimate that it actually feels odd to mention it. It seems so
natural to want what we like and to avoid what we don't like that we
sometimes feel a sense of unnatural horror when another person appears
to violate that rule; then we think, They surely wouldn't do such things
unless, deep down, they really wanted to. It is as though we feel that
people ought to want only to do the things they like to do.

But the relation between wanting and liking is not simple at all,
because our preferences are the end products of so many negotiations
among our agencies. To accomplish any substantial goal, we must renounce
the other possibilities and engage machinery to keep ourselves from
succumbing to nostalgia or remorse. Then we use words like *liking* to
express the operation of the mechanisms that hold us to our choice.
Liking's job is shutting off alternatives; we ought to understand its
role since, unconstrained, it narrows down our universe. This leads to
liking's artificial clarity: it does not reflect what liking is but only
shows what liking does.
