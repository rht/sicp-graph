*17.8* attachment-images
------------------------

> Guilt is the gift that keeps on giving. —Jewish proverb

All people talk of goals and dreams, of personal priorities, of goods
and bads, rights and wrongs, virtues and depravities. What makes our
ethics and ideals develop in our children's minds?

In one of the theories of Sigmund Freud, an infant becomes enamored of
one or both parents, and somehow this leads the baby into absorbing or,
as Freud put it, *introjecting* the goals and values of those
love-objects. Thenceforth, throughout later life, those parent-images
persist inside the grown-up child's mind, to influence whatever thoughts
and goals are considered worthy of pursuit. We are not compelled to
agree with all of Freud's account, but we have to explain why children
develop models of their parents' values at all.

So far as the child's safety is concerned, it would suffice for
attachment to keep the child in the parents' physical vicinity. What
could be the biological and psychological functions of developing
complicated self-ideals?

The answer seems quite clear to me. Consider that our models of
ourselves are so complex that even adults can't explain them. How could
a fragmentary infant mind know enough to build such a complicated thing
— without some model upon which to base it? We aren't horn with built-in
Selves — but most of us are fortunate enough to he born with human
caretakers. Then, our attachment mechanisms force us to focus on our
parents' ways, and this leads us to build crude images of what those
parents themselves are like. That way, the values and goals of a culture
pass from one generation to the next. They are not learned the way
skills are learned. We learn our earliest values under the influence of
attachment-related signals that represent, not our own success or
failure, but our parents' love or rejection. When we maintain our
standards, we feel virtuous rather than merely successful. When we
violate those standards, we feel shame and guilt rather than mere
disappointment. This is not just a matter of words: those things are not
the same; it is like the difference between ends and means.

How could coherence be imposed upon a multitude of mindless agencies?
Freud may have been the first to see that this could emerge from the
effects of infant attachment. It was several more decades before
psychologists recognized that separating children from their attachments
can have devastating effects on the growth of their personalities. Freud
also observed that children frequently reject one parent in favor of the
other, in a process that suggests the cross-exclusiveness of sexual
jealousy; he called this the Oedipus complex. It seems plausible that
something of this sort ought to happen regardless of any connection
between attachment and sexuality. If a developing identity is based upon
that of another person, it must become confusing to be attached to two
dissimilar adult *models.* This might lead a child to try to simplify
the situation by rejecting or removing one of them from the scene.

Many people dislike the thought of being dominated from within by the
image of a parent's wish. Yet, in exchange, that slavery is just what
makes us relatively free (as compared with other animals) from being
forced to obey so many other kinds of unlearned, built-in
instinct-goals.
