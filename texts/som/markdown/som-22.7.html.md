*22.7* causes and clauses
-------------------------

For virtually every change we see, we tend to seek some cause. And when
we find no cause on the scene, we'll postulate that one exists, even
though we might be wrong. We do this so consistently that I wouldn't be
surprised to find that brains have built-in tendencies to try to
represent all situations in certain special ways:

THINGS. Whatever we may see or touch, we represent the scene in terms of
separate object-things. We do the same for representing processes and
mental states. In languages, these object-symbols tend to correspond to
nouns. DIFFERENCES. Whenever we discern a change or just compare two
different things, we represent this as a difference thing. In languages,
these often correspond to verbs.

CAUSES. Whenever we conceive of an action, change, or difference, we try
to assign a cause to it — that is, some other person, process, or thing
that we can hold to be responsible for it. In languages, causes often
take the forms of things. CLAUSES. Whatever structures we conceive are
dealt with like single things. In languages, this corresponds to
treating an entire phrase as though it were a single word.

In English, almost every sentence form demands some sort of Actor noun —
and I think this reflects the need to find a motive or a cause. Consider
how we place that it in *Soon it will begin to rain.* We're always
chopping complex situations into artificially clear-cut chunks which we
perceive as separate things. Then we notice various differences and
relationships among those parts and assign them to various parts of
speech. We string our words into clauses and our clauses into chains,
often interrupting one by inserting fragments of others inside it, yet
proceeding as though there were no interruptions at all. It has been
alleged that the construction of such structures is unique to the
grammar-machinery of language, but I suspect that languages evolved
those forms because of mechanisms deeper in the grain of how we think.
For example, when we talked about visual ambiguity, we saw that our
vision-systems are highly proficient at representing structures that
interrupt one another. This suggests that both our visual and linguistic
abilities to deal with *interruptions* could be based on similar methods
with which we *manage* what is represented in our short-term memories.

In any case, our brains appear to make us seek to represent
dependencies. Whatever happens, where or when, we're prone to wonder who
or what's responsible. This leads us to discover explanations that we
might not otherwise imagine, and that helps us predict and control not
only what happens in the world, but also what happens in our minds. But
what if those same tendencies should lead us to imagine things and
causes that do not exist? Then we'll invent false gods and superstitions
and see their hand in every chance coincidence. Indeed, perhaps that
strange word *I* — as used in *I just had a good idea* — reflects the
selfsame tendency. If you're compelled to find some cause that causes
everything you do — why, then, that something needs a name. You call it
*me.* I call it *you.*
