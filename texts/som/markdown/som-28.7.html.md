*28.7* individual identities
----------------------------

Suppose I had once borrowed your boat and, secretly, replaced each board
with a similar but different one. Then, later, when I brought it back,
did I return your boat to you? What kind of question is that? It's
really not about boats at all, but about what people mean by *same.* For
*same* is never absolute but always a matter of degree. If I had merely
changed one plank, we'd all agree that it's still your boat — but after
all its parts are changed, we're not so sure of its identity. In any
case, we do not doubt that the second boat will behave in much the same
way — to the extent that all those substituted boards are suitably
equivalent.

What has this to do with brains? Well, now suppose that we could replace
each of your brain cells with a specially designed computer chip that
performs the same functions, and then suppose that we interconnect these
devices just as your brain cells are connected. If we put it in the same
environment, this new machine would reproduce the same processes as
those within your brain. Would that new machine be the same as you?
Again, the real question is not what we mean by *you,* but what we mean
by *same.* There isn't any reason to doubt that the substitute machine
would think and feel the same kinds of thoughts and feelings that you do
— since it embodies all the same processes and memories. Indeed, it
would surely be disposed to declare, with all your own intensity, that
it is you. Would that machine be right or wrong? As far as I can see,
this, too, is merely a matter of words. A mind is a way in which each
state gives rise to the state that follows it. If that new machine had a
suitable body and were placed in a similar environment, its sequence of
thoughts would be essentially the same as yours — since its mental
states would be equivalent to yours.

Modifying or replacing the physical parts of a brain will not affect the
mind it embodies, unless this alters the successions of states in that
brain.

You might object to this idea about duplicating minds on the grounds
that it would never be practical to duplicate enough details. You could
argue the same about that borrowed boat: no matter how carefully a
carpenter were to copy every board, there would always remain some
differences. This plank would be a little too stiff, that one would be a
little too weak, and no two of them would bend in exactly the same way.
The copied boat would never be precisely the same — even though you
might need a microscope to see the differences. For similar reasons, it
would be impractical to duplicate, with absolute fidelity, all the
interactions in a brain. For example, our brain cells are all immersed
in a liquid that conducts electricity, which means that every cell has
at least a small effect on every other cell. If we tried to imitate your
brain with a network of computer chips, many of those tiny interactions
would be left out.

Can you then boast that your duplicated brain-machine would not have the
same mind as yours because its computer chips don't work exactly like
the brain cells they purport to replace? No; you'd get more than you
bargained for if you argued that the new machine was not the same as
you, merely because of microscopic differences. Consider that as you
age, you're never the same as a moment ago. If such small differences
matter that much, this would prove that you yourself are not the same as
you.
