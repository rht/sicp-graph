*14.6* parts and holes
----------------------

As an example of reformulation, we'll represent the concept of a box in
the form of a machine that has a goal. We can use this to understand the
Hand-Change phenomenon. What makes a Block-Arch trap a person's arm so
that there's no way to escape except to withdraw? One way to explain
this is to imagine the arch as made of four potential obstacles — that
is, if we include the floor.

An obstacle is an object that interferes with the goal of moving in a
certain direction. To be trapped is to be unable to move in any
acceptable direction. Why does the block-arch form a trap? The simplest
explanation is that each of its four sides is a separate obstacle that
keeps us from escaping in a certain direction. (For our present
purposes, we'll regard moving the hand forward or backward as
unacceptable.) Therefore we're trapped, since there are only four
acceptable directions — up, down, left, or right — and each of them is
separately blocked. Psychologically, however, there's something missing
in that explanation: it doesn't quite describe our sense of being
trapped. When you're caught inside a box, you feel as though something
is trying to keep you there. The box seems more than just its separate
sides; you don't feel trapped by any particular side. It seems more like
a conspiracy in which each obstacle is made more effective because of
how all the other obstacles work together to keep you from going around
it. In the next section we'll assemble an agency that represents this
active sense of frustration by showing how those obstacles cooperate to
keep you in.

In order to represent this concept of trap or enclosure, we'll first
need a way to represent the idea of a container. To simplify matters,
instead of trying to deal with a genuine, six-sided, three-dimensional
boxlike container, we'll consider only a two-dimensional, four-sided
rectangle. This will let us continue to use our Block-Arch uniframe,
together with that extra side to represent the floor.

Why focus so sharply on the concept of a container? Because without that
concept, we could scarcely understand the structure of the spatial
world. Indeed, every normal child spends a great deal of time learning
about space-surrounding shapes — as physical implements for containing,
protecting, or imprisoning objects. But the same idea is also important
not only physically, but psychologically, as a mental implement for
envisioning and understanding other, more complicated structures. This
is because the idea of a set of *all possible directions* is one of the
great, coherent, cross-realm correspondences that can be used in many
different realms of thought.
