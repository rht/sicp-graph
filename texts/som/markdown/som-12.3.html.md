*12.3* uniframes
----------------

The child in our Block-Arch scene examined several different
arrangements of blocks — yet ended up describing them as all the same!
The great accomplishment was in discovering how to describe all the
different instances of arch with the selfsame phrase, *a top supported
by two standing blocks that do not touch.* I'll use the new word
*uniframe* for this — a description constructed to apply to several
different things at once. How does a person make a uniframe?

Our child's Block-Arch uniframe was constructed in several steps — and
each step used a different learning-scheme! The first step dissects the
scene into blocks with specific properties and relationships; some were
*lying down* or *standing up,* and some were touching or supporting
other ones. Next, we required our uniframe to insist that the arch top
must be supported by the standing blocks: let's call this enforcement.
Then, we required our uniframe to reject structures in which the two
standing blocks touch one another;

we could call this prevention: a way to keep from accepting an undesired
situation. Finally, we required our uniframe to be neutral about the
arch top's shape in order to keep from making distinctions we don't
consider relevant. Let's call that tolerance.

How does a person know how to choose which features and relations to
enforce, prevent, or tolerate? When we compared the two structures
below, we enforced the relation that A is supported by B and C. But
think of all the other differences we could have emphasized instead.

Was it wasteful to use only one of these facts when we could have used
them all? Should we learn to exploit all the information we can get? No!
There are good reasons not to notice too much, for every seemingly
essential fact can generate a universe of useless, accidental, and even
misleading facts.

Most differences are redundant. Most of the rest are accidents.

For example, suppose that we already know A is supported by B. There is
then no need to remember that A touches B or that A is above B — because
these are things that we can figure out. For a different kind of
example, suppose we knew that A was not supported by B. It then seems
unnecessary to remember that *A was to the right of B.* Common sense can
tell us that if A is not on B, it must lie somewhere else. However, at
least in the present context, it does not matter whether that *somewhere
else* is to the right; another time it might just as likely lie to the
left. If we stored such details too recklessly, our minds would get
cluttered up with useless facts.

But how can we judge which facts are useful? On what basis can we decide
which features are essential and which are merely accidents? Such
questions can't be answered as they stand. They make no sense apart from
how we want to use their answers. There is no single secret, magic trick
to learning; we simply have to learn a large society of different ways
to learn!
