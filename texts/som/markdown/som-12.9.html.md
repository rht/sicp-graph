*12.9* the exception principle
------------------------------

What should one do with a law or rule that doesn't always work? We saw
one way when we developed our uniframe for the Block-Arch. We simply
kept changing it to fit each new example. But what if, after all that
work, there still remain exceptions that don't fit?

The Exception Principle: It rarely pays to tamper with a rule that
nearly always works. It's better just to complement it with an
accumulation of specific exceptions.

All children learn that birds can fly and that animals that swim are
fish. So what should they do when told that penguins and ostriches are
birds that cannot fly, or that whales and porpoises are animals that
swim but aren't fish? What should the children do with uniframes that no
longer work so well? The exception principle says: Do not change them
too hastily. We should never expect rules to be perfect but only to say
what is typical. And if we try to modify each rule, to take each
exception into account, our descriptions will become too cumbersome to
use. It's not so bad to start with *Birds can fly* and later change it
into *Birds can fly, unless they are penguins or ostriches.* But if you
continue to seek perfection, your rules will turn into monstrosities:

Birds can fly, unless they are penguins and ostriches, or if they happen
to be dead, or have broken wings, or are confined to cages, or have
their feet stuck in cement, or have undergone experiences so dreadful as
to render them psychologically incapable of flight.

Unless we treat exceptions separately, they'll wreck all the
generalizations we may try to make. Consider why the commonsense idea of
fish is so useful. It is an accumulation of general information about a
class of things that have much in common: animals that live in the
water, have a certain sort of streamlined shape, and move by wriggling
their bodies and fanning the water with various finlike appendages.
However, a biologist's idea of fish is very different, being more
involved with the origins and internal mechanisms of those animals. This
leads to emphasizing aspects less evident to the eye: if whales have
lungs where trout have gills, they must be uniframed in different ways.
Children are disturbed to hear that whales are not fish because they are
usually more concerned with uses and appearances than with origins and
mechanisms. They're more likely to want classifications like these:

What do those animals do? Where do they live? Are they easy to catch?
Are they dangerous? Are they useful? What do they eat? How do they
taste?

The power of ordinary words like *fish* comes from how we make them span
so many meaning-worlds at once. However, in order to do this, we have to
be able to tolerate many exceptions. We almost never find rules that
have no exceptions — except in certain special, artificial worlds that
we ourselves create by making up their rules and regulations to begin
with. Artificial realms like mathematics and theology are built from the
start to be devoid of interesting inconsistency. But we must be careful
not to mistake our own inventions for natural phenomena we have
discovered. To insist on perfect laws in real life is to risk not
finding any laws at all. Only in the sciences, where every exception
must be explained, does it make sense to pay that price.
