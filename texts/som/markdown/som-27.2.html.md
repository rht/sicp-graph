*27.2* suppressors
------------------

It would be wonderful never to make mistakes. One way would be to always
have such perfect thoughts that none of them is ever wrong. But such
perfection can't be reached. Instead we try, as best we can, to
recognize our bad ideas before they do much harm. We can thus imagine
two poles of self-improvement. On one side we try to stretch the range
of the ideas we generate: this leads to more ideas, but also to more
mistakes. On the other side, we try to learn not to repeat mistakes
we've made before. All communities evolve some prohibitions and taboos
to tell their members what they shouldn't do. That, too, must happen in
our minds: we accumulate memories to tell ourselves what we shouldn't
think.

But how could we make an agent to prevent us from doing something that,
in the past, has led to bad or ineffectual results? Ideally, that agent
would keep us from even thinking that bad idea again. But that seems
almost paradoxical, like telling someone, *Don't think about a monkey!*
Yet there is a way to accomplish this. To see how it works,

imagine the sequence of mental states that led to a certain mistake:

We could prevent the undesired action from taking place by introducing
an agent that recognizes the state which, in the past, preceded the
undesired action.

Suppressor-agents wait until you get a certain *bad idea.* Then they
prevent your taking the corresponding action, and make you wait until
you think of some alternative. If a suppressor could speak, it would
say, *Stop thinking that!*

Suppressors could indeed prevent us from repeating actions that we've
learned are bad. But it is inefficient to wait until we actually reach
undesirable states, then have to *backtrack.* It would be more efficient
to anticipate such lines of thought so that we never reach those states
at all. In the next section we'll see how to do this by using agents
called censors.

Censor-agents need not wait until a certain bad idea occurs; instead,
they intercept the states of mind that usually precede that thought. If
a censor could speak, it would say, *Don't even begin to think that!*

Though censors were conceived of long ago by Sigmund Freud, they're
scarcely mentioned in present-day psychology. I suspect that this is a
serious oversight and that censors play fundamental roles in how we
learn and how we think. Perhaps the trouble is that our censors work too
well. For, naturally, it is easier for psychologists to study only what
someone does — instead of what someone doesn't do.
