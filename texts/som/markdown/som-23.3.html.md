*23.3* time blinking
--------------------

Fortunately, there is a way to get around the duplication problem
entirely. Let's take a cue from how a perfume makes a strong impression
first, but then appears to fade away, or how, when you put your hand in
water that is very hot or very cold, the sensation is intense at first —
but will soon disappear almost entirely. As we say, we *get used to*
these sensations. Why? Because our senses react mainly to how things
change in time. This is true even for the sensors in our eyes — though
normally we're unaware of it because our eyes are always moving
imperceptibly. Most of the sensory agents that inform our brains about
the world are sensitive only to various sorts of time changes — and
that, surely, is also true of most of the agents inside the brain.

Any agent that is sensitive to changes in time can also be used to
detect differences. For whenever we expose such an agent, first to a
situation A and then to a situation B, any output from

that agent will signify some difference between A and B.

This suggests a way to solve the duplication problem. Since most agents
can be made to serve as difference-agents, we can compare two
descriptions simply by presenting them to the same agency at different
times. This is easily done if that agency is equipped with a pair of
high-speed, temporary K-line memories. Then we need only load the two
descriptions into those memories and compare them by activating first
one and then the other.

Store the first description in pronome p. Store the second description
in pronome q. Activate p and q in rapid succession. Then any changes in
the agents' outputs represent differences between A and B!

We can use this trick to implement the scheme we described for escaping
from a topless-arch. Suppose that p describes the present situation and
q describes a box that permits no escape. Each Move agent is designed to
detect the appearance of a wall. If we simply *blink*

from the present situation to the box frame, one of these agents will
announce the appearance of any box wall that was not already apparent in
the present situation. Thus, automatically, this scheme will find all
the directions that are not closed off. If the outputs of the Move
agents were connected to cause you to move in the corresponding
direction, this agency would lead you to escape!

The method of time blinking can also be used to simplify our
difference-engine scheme for composing verbal expressions, since now the
speaker can maintain both p and q inside the selfsame agency. If not for
this, each speaker would need what would amount to a duplicate society
of mind in order to simulate the listener's state. Although the method
of time blinking is powerful and efficient, it has some limitations; for
example, it cannot directly recognize relations among more than two
things at a time. I suspect that people share this limitation, too — and
this may be why we have relatively few language-forms, like *between*
and *middle,* for expressing three-way comparisons and relationships.
