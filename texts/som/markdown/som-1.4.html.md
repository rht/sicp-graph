*1.4* The world of blocks
-------------------------

Your browser does not support the video tag.

Imagine a child playing with blocks, and imagine that this child's mind
contains a host of smaller minds. Call them mental agents. Right now, an
agent called Builder is in control. Builder's specialty is making towers
from blocks.

Our child likes to watch a tower grow as each new block is placed on
top. But building a tower is too complicated a job for any single,
simple agent, so Builder has to ask for help from several other agents:

In fact, even to find another block and place it on the tower top is too
big for a job for any single agent. So Add, in turn, must call for other
agents' help. Before we're done, we'll need more agents than would fit
in any diagram.

Why break things into such small parts? Because minds, like towers, are
made that way — except that they're composed of processes instead of
blocks. And if making stacks of blocks seems insignificant — remember
that you didn't always feel that way. When first you found some building
toys in early childhood, you probably spent joyful weeks of learning
what to do with them. If such toys now seem relatively dull, then you
must ask yourself how you have changed. Before you turned to more
ambitious things, it once seemed strange and wonderful to be able to
build a tower or a house of blocks.

Yet, though all grown-up persons know how to do such things, no one
understands how we learn to do them! And that is what will concern us
here. To pile up blocks into heaps and rows: these are skills each of us
learned so long ago that we can't remember learning them at all. Now
they seem mere common sense — and that's what makes psychology hard.
This forgetfulness, the amnesia of infancy, makes us assume that all our
wonderful abilities were always there inside our minds, and we never
stop to ask ourselves how they began and grew.

We found a way to make our tower builder out of parts. But Builder is
really far from done. To build a simple stack of blocks, our child's
agents must accomplish all these other things.

See must recognize its blocks, whatever their color, size, and place —
in spite of different backgrounds, shades, and lights, and even when
they're partially obscured by other things.

Then, once that's done, Move has to guide the arm and hand through
complicated paths in space, yet never strike the tower's top or hit the
child's face.

And think how foolish it would seem, if Find were to see, and Grasp were
to grasp, a block supporting the tower top!

When we look closely at these requirements, we find a bewildering world
of complicated questions. For example, how could Find determine which
blocks are still available for use? It would have to *understand* the
scene in terms of what it is trying to do. This means that we'll need
theories both about what it means to understand and about how a machine
could have a goal. Consider all the practical judgments that an actual
Builder would have to make. It would have to decide whether there are
enough blocks to accomplish its goal and whether they are strong and
wide enough to support the others that will be placed on them.

What if the tower starts to sway? A real builder must guess the cause.
It is because some joint inside the column isn't square enough? Is the
foundation insecure, or is the tower too tall for its width? Perhaps it
is only because the last block was placed too roughly.

All children learn about such things, but we rarely ever think about
them in our later years. By the time we are adults we regard all of this
to be simple *common sense.* But that deceptive pair of words conceals
almost countless different skills.

Common sense is not a simple thing. Instead, it is an immense society of
hard-earned practical ideas — of multitudes of life-learned rules and
exceptions, dispositions and tendencies, balances and checks.

If common sense is so diverse and intricate, what makes it seem so
obvious and natural? This illusion of simplicity comes from losing touch
with what happened during infancy, when we formed our first abilities.
As each new group of skills matures, we build more layers on top of
them. As time goes on, the layers below become increasingly remote
until, when we try to speak of them in later life, we find ourselves
with little more to say than *I don't know.*

We want to explain intelligence as a combination of simpler things. This
means that we must be sure to check, at every step, that none of our
agents is, itself, intelligent. Otherwise, our theory would end up
resembling the nineteenth-century *chessplaying machine* that was
exposed by Edgar Allan Poe to actually conceal a human dwarf inside.
Accordingly, whenever we find that an agent has to do anything
complicated, we'll replace it with a subsociety of agents that do
simpler things. Because of this, the reader must be prepared to feel a
certain sense of loss. When we break things down to their smallest
parts, they'll each seem dry as dust at first, as though some essence
has been lost.

For example, we've seen how to construct a tower-building skill by
making Builder from little parts like Find and Get. Now, where does its
*knowing-how-to-build* reside when, clearly, it is not in any part — and
yet those parts are all that Builder is? The answer: It is not enough to
explain only what each separate agent does. We must also understand how
those parts are interrelated — that is, how groups of agents can
accomplish things.

Accordingly, each step in this book uses two different ways to think
about agents. If you were to watch Builder work, from the outside, with
no idea of how it works inside, you'd have the impression that it knows
how to build towers. But if you could see Builder from the inside, you'd
surely find no knowledge there. You would see nothing more than a few
switches, arranged in various ways to turn each other on and off. Does
Builder *really know* how to build towers? The answer depends on how you
look at it. Let's use two different words, *agent* and *agency,* to say
why Builder seems to lead a double life. As agency, it seems to know its
job. As agent, it cannot know anything at all.

When you drive a car, you regard the steering wheel as an agency that
you can use to change the car's direction. You don't care how it works.
But when something goes wrong with the steering, and you want to
understand what's happening, it's better to regard the steering wheel as
just one agent in a larger agency: it turns a shaft that turns a gear to
pull a rod that shifts the axle of a wheel. Of course, one doesn't
always want to take this microscopic view; if you kept all those details
in mind while driving, you might crash because it took too long to
figure out which way to turn the wheel. Knowing how is not the same as
knowing why. In this book, we'll always be switching between agents and
agencies because, depending on our purposes, we'll have to use different
viewpoints and kinds of descriptions.
