*19.4* objects and properties
-----------------------------

What does a word like *apple* mean? This is really many questions in
one.

How could hearing the word *apple* make you *imagine* an apple? How
could seeing an apple activate a word-agent for *apple*? How could
thinking about an apple make one think of the word for *apple*? How
could seeing an apple make one wordlessly recall the flavor of an apple?

It's usually impossible to perfectly *define* a word because you cannot
capture everything you mean in just a phrase; an apple means a thousand
things. However, you can usually say some of what you mean by making
lists of properties. For example, you could say that an *apple* is
something round and red and good to eat. But what exactly is a
*property*? Again, it's hard to define that idea — but there are several
things to say about what properties we like our properties to have.

We like the kinds of properties that do not change capriciously.

The color of your car will stay the same from day to day, and, barring
accidents, so will its basic size and shape, as well as the substances
of which it is made. Now, suppose you were to paint that car a new
color: its shape and size would remain the same. This suggests another
thing we like to find in our properties:

The most useful sets of properties are those whose members do not
interact too much.

This explains the universal popularity of that particular combination of
properties: size, color, shape, and substance. Because these attributes
scarcely interact at all with one another, you can put them together in
any combination whatsoever, to make an object that is either large or
small, red or green, wooden or glass, and having the shape of a sphere
or of a cube. And we derive a wonderful power from representing things
in terms of properties that do not interact: this makes imagination
practical. It lets us anticipate what will happen when we invent new
combinations and variations we've never seen before. For example,
suppose that a certain object almost works for a certain job — except
for being a bit too small; then you can imagine using a *larger* one. In
the same way, you can imagine changing the color of a dress or its size,
shape, or the fabric of which it's made, without altering any of its
other properties.

Why is it so easy to imagine the effects of such changes? First, these
properties reflect the nature of reality; when we change an object's
color or shape, its other properties are usually left unchanged.
However, that doesn't explain why such changes do not interact inside
the mind. Why is it so easy to imagine a small brown wooden cube or a
long red silk skirt? The simplest explanation is that we represent each
of the properties of material, color, size and shape in separate
agencies. Then those properties can simultaneously arouse separate
partial states of mind at once, in several divisions of the mind. That
way, a single word can activate many different kinds of thoughts at
once! Thus the word *apple* can set your Color agency into a *redness*
state, put your Shape agency into a *roundness* state — or, really, into
a representation of an indented sphere with a stem — and cause your
Taste and Size agencies to react in accord with memories of previous
experiences with apples. How does language do such things?
