*17.10* intellectual trauma

One of Freud's conceptions was that the growth of many individuals is
shaped by unsuspected fears that lurk in our unconscious minds. These
powerful anxieties include the dread of punishment or injury or
helplessness or, worst of all, the loss of the esteem of those to whom
we are attached. Whether this is true or not, most psychologists who
hold this view apply it only to the social realm, assuming that the
world of intellect is too straightforward and impersonal to be involved
with such feelings. But intellectual development can depend equally upon
attachments to other persons and can be similarly involved with buried
fears and dreads.

Later, when we discuss the nature of humor and jokes, we'll see that
many of the consequences of both social and intellectual failures are
rather similar. A major difference is that in the social world, only
other persons can inform us about our violations of taboos — whereas
within the realm of intellect, we can often detect our own deficiencies.

A tower-building child needs no teacher to complain when a misplaced
block spoils all the work. Nor does a thinking child's mind need anyone
to tell it when some paradox engulfs and whirls it into a frightening
cyclone. By itself, the failure to achieve a goal can cause anxiety. For
example, surely every child must once have thought along this line:

Hmmm. Ten is nearly eleven. And eleven is nearly twelve. So ten is
nearly twelve. And so on. If l keep on reasoning this way, then ten must
be nearly a hundred!

To an adult, this is just a stupid joke. But earlier in life, such an
incident could have produced a crisis of self-confidence and
helplessness. To put it in more grown-up terms, the child might think, I
can't see anything wrong with my reasoning — and yet it led to bad
results. I merely used the obvious fact that if A is near B, and B is
near C, then A must be near C. I see no way that could be wrong — so
there must be something wrong with my mind. Whether or not we can
recollect it, we must once have felt some distress at being made to
sketch the nonexistent boundaries between the oceans and the seas.

What was it like to first consider *Which came first, the chicken or the
egg?* What came before the start of time; what lies beyond the edge of
space? And what of sentences like *This statement is false,* which can
throw the mind into a spin? I don't know anyone who recalls such
incidents as frightening. But then, as Freud might say, this very fact
could be a hint that the area is subject to censorship.

If people bear the scars of scary thoughts, why don't these lead, as our
emotion-traumas are supposed to do, to phobias, compulsions, and the
like? I suspect the answer is that they do — but disguised in forms we
don't perceive as pathological. Every teacher knows and loathes how
certain children turn away from learning things they believe they cannot
learn: *I simply can't. I'm just no good at that.* Sometimes this might
represent only a learned way to avoid the shame and stress that came
from social censure of failures in the past. But it might equally
represent a reaction to the nonsocial stress that came from having been
unable to deal with certain ideas themselves. Today, we generally regard
emotional incompetence as an illness to be remedied. However, we
generally accept incompetence of intellect as a normal, if unfortunate,
deficiency in *talents,* *aptitudes,* and

*gifts.* Accordingly, we say things like *That child isn't very bright,*
as though that person's poverty of thought were part of some predestined
fate — and, therefore, isn't anyone's fault.
