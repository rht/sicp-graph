*10.7* the concept of concept
-----------------------------

In learning their Societies-of-More, children learn various skills for
comparing different qualities and quantities, like number and extent. It
is tempting to try to summarize all that by saying that the children are
learning something; we could call it the concept of quantity. But why do
we feel we have to think of what we learn as things or concepts? Why
must we *thingify* everything?

What is a thing? No one doubts that a child's building-block is a thing.
But is a child's love for its mother also a *thing*? We're imprisoned by
our poverty of words because even though we have good ways to describe
objects and actions, we lack methods for describing dispositions and
processes. We can scarcely speak of what minds do except as though they
were filled with things that one could see or touch; that's why we cling
to terms like *concepts* and *ideas.* I don't mean to say that this is
always bad, for *thing-ifying* is indeed a splendid mental instrument.
But for our present purpose, it is disastrous to assume that our minds
contain some single *concept of quantity.* At different times, a word
like *more* can mean many different kinds of things. Think about each of
these expressions.

More colorful. More loud. More swift. More valuable. More complicated.

We speak as though these were similar, yet each of them involves a
different, hard-earned web of ways to think! The phrase *more loud*
might seem at first to be merely a matter of magnitude. But consider how
the sound of a distant gong seems louder than a whisper near the ear —
no matter that its actual intensity is less. Your reaction to what you
hear depends not only on its physical intensity, but also on what your
agencies conclude about the character of its source. Thus you can
usually tell whether a gong is loud but distant, rather than soft but
close, by unconsciously making assumptions about the origin of that
sound. And all those other kinds of *more* engage equally subtle sorts
of expertise.

Instead of assuming that our children come to crystallize a single
*concept of quantity,* we must try to discover how our children
accumulate and classify their many methods for comparing things. How do
agents like Tall, Thin, Short, and Wide get formed into subagencies? To
an adult, it seems natural to associate both being taller and being
wider with being larger. But what prevents the child from inventing
senseless *concepts* such as *being Green and Tall and having recently
been touched*? No child has the time to generate and test all possible
combinations to find which ones are sensible. Life is too short to do
that many bad experiments! The secret is: always try to combine related
agents first. Tall, Thin, Short, and Wide are all closely related,
because they are all concerned with making comparisons between spatial
qualities. In fact, they probably involve agencies that are close to one
another in the brain and share so many agents in common that they'll
naturally seem similar.
