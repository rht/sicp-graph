*30.1* knowing
--------------

What does *knowing* really mean? Suppose Mary (or some other creature or
machine) can answer certain questions about the world — without the need
to do any actual experiments. Then we'd agree that Mary knows those
things about the world. But what would it mean, to you or to me, to hear
Jack say that *Mary knows geometry*? For all we know, Mary might believe
that circles are squares and it happens that Jack agrees! Jack's
statement tells us more about Jack than about Mary.

When Jack says, *Mary knows geometry,* this indicates to us that Jack
would probably be satisfied by Mary's answers to the questions about
geometry that he would be disposed to ask.

The meaning of *Mary knows geometry* depends on who is saying it. After
all, no one knows everything about geometry; that statement would not
mean the same to us as to a mathematician, whose concepts of geometry
are different from those of ordinary persons. In the same way, the
meanings of many other terms depend upon the speaker's role. Even an
apparently unambiguous statement like *This is a painting of a horse*
shares this character: you can be sure of little more than that it
displays a representation that in someone's view resembles a horse in
some respects.

Then why, when we talk about knowledge, don't we have to say who all
those speakers and observers are? Because we make assumptions by
default. When a stranger says that Mary knows geometry, we simply assume
that the speaker would expect any typical person who knows Mary to agree
that she knows geometry. Assumptions like that allow us to communicate;
unless there is some reason to think otherwise, we assume that all the
things involved are *typical.* It does not bother us that a professional
mathematician might not agree that Mary knows geometry — because a
mathematician doesn't fit our stereotype of a *typical person.*

You might maintain that none of this applies to you, since you know what
you know about geometry. But there's still an observer on the scene,
only now it is hiding inside your mind — namely, the portion of *you*
that claims you know geometry. But the part of you that makes this claim
has little in common with the other parts that actually do geometry for
you; those agencies are probably incapable of speech and probably devoid
of thoughts about your knowledge and beliefs.

Naturally, we'd all prefer to think of knowledge as more positive and
less provisional or relative. But little good has ever come from trying
to link what we believe to our ideals about absolute truths. We always
yearn for certainty, but the only thing beyond dispute is that there's
always room for doubt. And doubt is not an enemy that sets constraints
on what we know; the real danger to mental growth is perfect faith,
doubt's antidote.
