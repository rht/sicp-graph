*17.7* genetic timetables
-------------------------

When we first introduced Papert's principle — that is, the idea of
growing by inserting new levels of management into old agencies — we did
not ask when new layers should be built. If managers are inserted too
soon, when their workers are still immature, little will get done. And
if those managers come too late, that, too, would delay the mental
growth. What could ensure that managers are not engaged too late or too
soon? We all know children who seem to have matured too quickly or too
slowly, in various respects, to match other areas of their growth. In an
ideal system, each developing agency would be controlled by another
agency equipped to introduce new agents just when they're needed — that
is, when enough has been learned to justify the start of another stage.
In any case, it would surely be disastrous if all our potential capacity
to learn became available too soon. If every agent could learn from
birth, they'd all be overwhelmed by infantile ideas.

One way to regulate such things would be to actuate new agencies at
genetically predetermined times. At various stages of biological
*maturity,* certain classes of agents would be enabled to establish new
connections, while others would be forced to slow their growth by making
permanent connections that, till then, had been reversible. Could any
clockwork scheme like this be guaranteed to work? Consider the fact that
most of our children acquire agents like Reversible and Confined before
they are five years old. For those children, at least, it would suffice
to activate new intermediate-level agents at that age, so those children
could proceed to build agents like Appearance and History. However,
children who weren't ready yet would then be slightly handicapped by
being forced to build some less-than-usually effective
Societies-of-More. Nor would that rigid maturation- schedule serve well
those children who had already moved *ahead of schedule.* It would be
better to have systems in which the timing of each stage depends on what
has actually happened earlier.

One way a stagelike episode might start could stem from what we called
the investment principle: once a certain skill surpasses all its close
competitors, it becomes increasingly likely to be employed — and thereby
increases its opportunities to develop even further. This self-enhancing
effect can cause a spurt of rapid progress in which a particular skill
quickly comes to dominate the scene. One way a stagelike episode might
end could stem from what we called the exception principle. To see how
this could happen, suppose that a certain agency develops so useful a
way to do some job that many other agencies soon learn to exploit that
capability. The more those other agencies become dependent on that
skill, the more disruption will result from every further *improvement*
in it — since it now has more customers to please! Even increasing the
speed of one process could damage other agencies that depend upon how
long it takes to work. Thus, once a scheme persists for long enough, it
gets to be extremely hard to change — not because of limitations
inherent in itself or in the agency that developed it, but because of
how the rest of the society depends upon its present form.

Once it becomes too hard to change an old agency, it is time to build
another one; further progress may require revolution rather than
evolution. This is another reason why a complex system must be grown in
a sequence of separate steps.
