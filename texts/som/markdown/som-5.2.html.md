*5.2* unanswerable questions
----------------------------

When we reflect on anything for long enough, we're likely to end up with
what we sometimes call *basic* questions — ones we can see no way at all
to answer. For we have no perfect way to answer even this question: How
can one tell when a question has been properly answered?

What caused the universe, and why? How can you tell which beliefs are
true? What is the purpose of life? How can you tell what is good?

These questions seem different on the surface, but all of them share one
quality that makes them impossible to answer: all of them are circular!
You can never find a final cause, since you must always ask one question
more: *What caused that cause?* You can never find any ultimate goal,
since you're always obliged to ask, *Then what purpose does that serve?*
Whenever you find out why something is good — or is true — you still
have to ask what makes that reason good and true. No matter what you
discover, at every step, these kinds of questions will always remain,
because you have to challenge every answer with, *Why should I accept
that answer?* Such circularities can only waste our time by forcing us
to repeat, over and over and over again, *What good is Good?* and, *What
god made God?*

When children keep on asking, *Why?* we adults learn to deal with this
by simply saying, *Just because!* This may seem obstinate, but it's also
a form of self-control. What stops adults from dwelling on such
questions endlessly? The answer is that every culture finds special ways
to deal with these questions. One way is to brand them with shame and
taboo; another way is to cloak them in awe or mystery; both methods make
those questions undiscussable. Consensus is the simplest way — as with
those social styles and trends wherein we each accept as true whatever
all the others do. I think I once heard W. H. Auden say, *We are all
here on earth to help others. What I can't figure out is what the others
are here for.*

All human cultures evolve institutions of law, religion, and philosophy,
and these institutions both adopt specific answers to circular questions
and establish authority-schemes to indoctrinate people with those
beliefs. One might complain that such establishments substitute dogma
for reason and truth. But in exchange, they spare whole populations from
wasting time in fruitless reason loops. Minds can lead more productive
lives when working on problems that can be solved.

But when thinking keeps returning to its source, it doesn't always mean
something's wrong. For circular thinking can lead to growth when it
results, at each return, in deeper and more powerful ideas. Then,
because we can communicate, such systems of ideas may even find the
means to cross the boundaries of selfish selves — and thus take root in
other minds. This way, a language, science, or philosophy can transcend
the limitation of each single mind's mortality. Now, we cannot know that
any individual is destined for some paradise. Yet certain religions are
oddly right; they manage to achieve their goal of offering an afterlife
— if only to their own strange souls.
