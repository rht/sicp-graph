*26.11* grammar
---------------

How do we choose the words we speak, and how do we understand what
others say? Earlier, I suggested that in the course of learning language
we accumulate various processes and tactics that enable us to partially
reproduce our own mental operations in other speakers. These processes
affect our choices of words, the forms we select for phrases and
sentences, and the styles in which we frame our narratives. There have
been many attempts to study how children learn language, but
psychologists do not yet have coherent theories about the underlying
processes. For example, we do not yet even know whether we learn each
bit of grammar only once — or whether we have to learn it twice, for
speaking and for understanding what other people say.

We know so little about such matters that we can scarcely even speculate
about the nature of those early language-learning steps. Perhaps the
process starts with some agents that can enable a child to make various
vocal sounds in response to specific internal states. These agents then
become involved with built-in *predestined* learning processes that lead
to limited abilities to imitate other sounds the child hears by using
feedback from its ears. Later stages might then engage new layers of
agents that connect word-sound agents to whichever polynemes are most
frequently attached to certain pronomes in the language-agency. Once a
suitable variety of such processes are established, more layers of
frame- and memory- controlling agents could learn to support more
complex language skills.

Let's try to imagine what kind of process could produce a language
phrase that *expresses* a description of an object. Suppose, for
example, that you want to draw attention to a certain very big box. To
imagine such a thing in the first place, you might first have to
activate your polyneme for *box* and then arouse some other isonomes and
polynemes that modify the state of your Size agency. To express *very
big box* might thus require grammar-tactics that express three mental
operations:

--- *box* expresses the arousal of the box polyneme; --- *big* expresses
a process that selects the Size agency;

--- *very* expresses an isonome that adjusts the sensitivities of agents
in whichever agency was selected.

I do not mean to suggest that a child's earliest three-word noun phrases
must be based upon such complicated processes; more likely they begin
with simpler sequence scripts. Eventually, though, more complex systems
intervene to replace the simple scripts by intricate kinds of
frame-arrays that enable the child to make more complex rearrangements
of what becomes attached to its expression-frames. Then, as the
language-agency acquires more isonome-controlling skills, the child can
learn to use pronouns like *it* or *she* to express other structures
that are already attached to suitable pronomes. Also, as we develop
skills for building chains and trees from other frames, the
language-agency can learn to use corresponding grammar-tactics to
express those chains — stringing together phrases and sentences with
conjunction words like *and*

and *but.* Similarly, as we improve our methods for controlling memories
and managing interruptions, we can learn to combine those skills with
clause-interrupting forms like *who* and *which.* There seems scarcely
any limit to the complexity of our social inventions for expressing
mental processes, and it takes most children many years to master all
the language arts their ancestors evolved.
