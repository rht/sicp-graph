*12.11* how causes work
-----------------------

It's wonderful when we can find out something's cause. A tower is high
because each of its separate blocks contribute height; it stands because
those blocks are adequately firm and wide. A baby cries because it wants
food. A stone falls down because it's pulled by gravity. Why can we
explain so many things in terms of causes and effects? Is it because
there is a cause for everything — or do we merely learn to ask only
about the kinds of happenings that have causes? Is it that causes don't
exist at all but are inventions of our minds? The answer is all of the
above. Causes are indeed made up by minds — but only work in certain
parts of certain worlds.

What are causes, anyway? The very concept of a cause involves a certain
element of style: a causal explanation must be brief. Unless an
explanation is compact, we cannot use it as a prediction. We might agree
that X causes Y, if we see that Y depends more on X than on most other
things. But we wouldn't call X a cause of Y if describing X involved an
endless discourse that mentioned virtually everything else in the world.

There can't be any *causes* in a world in which everything that happens
depends more or less equally upon everything else that happens.

Indeed, it wouldn't make any sense to talk about a *thing* in such a
world. Our very notion of a *thing* assumes some constellation of
properties that stays the same (or changes in ways we can predict) when
other things around it change. When Builder moves a block, that block's
location will change — but not its color, weight, material, size, or
shape. How convenient that our world lets us change a thing's location
while leaving so many other properties unchanged! This lets us predict
the effect of motions so well that we can chain them into combinations
never tried before — yet still predict their principal effects.
Furthermore, because our universe has three *dimensions,* we can easily
predict the effect of combining several actions from knowing only their
effects in each of those three dimensions.

Why does a block retain its size and shape when it is moved? It is
because we're fortunate enough to live within a universe in which
effects are localized. A solid object with a stable shape can exist only
because its atoms *stick together* so tightly that when you move some of
them, the others are pulled along. But this can happen only in a
universe whose force laws work in close accord with the *nearnesses* of
time and space — in other words, a universe in which entities that are
far apart have much less effect on each other than ones that are close
together. In worlds without constraints like that, there could be no
*things* or *causes* for us to know.

To know the cause of a phenomenon is to know, at least in principle, how
to change or control some aspects of some entities without affecting all
the rest.

The most useful kinds of causes our minds can discern are predictable
relationships between the actions we can take and the changes we can
sense. This is why animals tend to evolve sensors that detect stimuli
that can be affected by those animals' own actions.
