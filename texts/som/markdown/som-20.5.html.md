*20.5* micronemes
-----------------

That old idea of classifying things by properties is not entirely
satisfactory, because so many kinds of qualities interact in complicated
ways. Every situation or condition we experience is influenced or, so to
speak, colored, by thousands of contextual shades and hues, just as
looking through a tinted glass has faint effects on everything we see.

material: animate, inanimate; natural, artificial; ideal, actual
perceptual: color, texture, taste, sound, temperature solidity:
hardness, density, flexibility, strength shape: angularity, curvature,
symmetry, verticality permanence: rarity, age, fragility, replaceability
location: office, home, vehicle, theater, city, forest, farm
environment: indoors, outdoors; public, private

activity: hunting, gambling, working, entertaining relationship:
cooperation, conflict; negotiating, confronting security: safety,
danger; refuge, exposure; escape, defeat Some of these conditions and
relationships may correspond to language-words, but for most of them we
have no words, just as we have no expressions for most flavors and
aromas, gestures and intonations, attitudes and dispositions. I'll call
them *micronemes* — those inner mental context clues that shade our
minds' activities in ways we can rarely express. There is a somewhat
different microstructure to each person's thoughts; indeed, their
inexpressibility reflects our individuality. Nevertheless, we can
clarify our image of the mind by envisioning these unknown influences as
embodied in the forms of particular agents. Accordingly, in the next few
sections, we'll envision our micronemes as K-lines that reach into many
agencies with widespread effects on the arousal and suppression of other
agents — including other micronemes. These micronemes participate in all
those *locking-in* and *weeding-out* processes, so that, for example,
the activity of your microneme for *outdoors* makes a small contribution
to arousing your *hunting* microneme. While each such effect may be
relatively small, the effects of activating many micronemes will usually
combine to establish a context within which most words are understood
unambiguously.

For example, in one context the word *Boston* might bring to mind some
thoughts about the American Revolution. In a different setting, the same
word might lead one to think instead of a geographic location. Other
contexts might yield thoughts about famous universities, sporting teams,
life-styles, accents of speech, or traditional meals. Each of these
concepts must be represented by a certain network of agents that are
connected, directly or indirectly, to the word-agent for Boston. But
hearing or thinking that word by itself is not enough to determine which
of those word-sense networks to activate; this must also depend upon
other aspects of the present context. Our hypothesis is that this comes
about principally through each word-sense agent learning to recognize
the activation of certain combinations of micronemes.

Even modest families of micronemes could span vast ranges of contexts. A
mere forty independent micronemes could specify a trillion different
contexts — and we surely have thousands, and perhaps millions of
different micronemes.
