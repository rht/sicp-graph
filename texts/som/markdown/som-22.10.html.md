*22.10* verbal expression
-------------------------

How easily people can communicate. We listen and speak without the
slightest sense of what's involved! One of us expresses an idea, the
other understands it, and neither thinks anything complicated has
happened; it seems as natural to talk as it is to walk. Yet both
simplicities are illusions. To walk, you must engage a vast array of
agencies to move your body down the street. To talk, you must engage a
vast array of agencies to build new structures in another person's mind.
But how do you know just what to say to affect that other person's
agencies?

Let's suppose that Mary wants to tell Jack something. This means there
is a certain structure p somewhere inside the network of Mary's agencies
— and that Mary's language-agency must construct a similar structure
inside Jack's mind. To do this, Mary will need to speak words that will
activate appropriate activities inside Jack's agencies, then correctly
link them together. How can she do that? Here is what we'll call the
*re-duplication* theory of how we formulate what we say:

Mary proceeds, step by step, to construct a new version of p — call it q
— inside her own mind. In doing this, she will apply various
memory-control operations to activate certain isonomes and polynemes. As
Mary performs each internal operation, her speech-agency selects certain
corresponding verbal expressions — and these cause similar operations to
occur inside Jack. As a result, Jack builds a structure similar to q. To
be able to do that, Mary must have learned at least one expressive
technique that corresponds to each frequently used mental operation. And
Jack must have learned to recognize those expressive techniques — we'll
call them grammar-tactics — and to use them to activate some
corresponding isonomes and polynemes.

To build her new version of p, Mary could employ a goal-achieving
scheme: she keeps comparing p with the latest version of q, and whenever
she senses a significant difference, she applies some operation to q
that removes or reduces the difference. For example, if Mary notices
that p has an Origin pronome where q lacks one, her memory-control
system will focus on p's Origin. In this case, if p itself is a motion
frame, the usual speech-tactic is to use the word *from.* Next she must
describe the substructure attached to p's Origin pronome. If this were a
simple polyneme like *Boston,* Mary's speech-agency could simply
pronounce the corresponding word. But if that pronome is assigned to
some more complicated structure, such as an entire frame, Mary's
language-agency must interrupt itself to copy that. This is expressed,
as we have seen, by using words like *who* or *which.* In any case, Mary
continues this difference- duplication process until she senses no
significant discrepancies between q and p. Of course, what Mary finds
significant depends on what she *wants to say.*

This *re-duplication* theory of speech describes only the first stages
of how we use language. In later stages, the mental operations we use to
construct q are not always immediately applied to pronouncing words.
Instead, we learn techniques for storing sequences of grammar-tactics
temporarily; this makes it possible to modify and rearrange our words
and sentences before we say them. Learning these arts takes a long time:
most children need a decade or more to complete their language-systems
and many keep learning, throughout their lives, to sense new sorts of
discrepancies and discover ways to express them.
