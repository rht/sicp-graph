*15.11* the recursion principle
-------------------------------

Let's consider one last time how a mind could juggle nonexistent
furniture inside an imaginary room. To compare different arrangements,
we must somehow maintain at least two different descriptions in the mind
at once. Can we store them in different agencies, both active at the
same time? That would mean splitting our space-arranging-agency into two
different smaller portions, each working on one of those descriptions.
On the surface, there's nothing clearly wrong with that. However, if
those smaller agencies became involved with similar jobs, then they, in
turn, would also have to split in two. And then we'd have to do each of
those jobs with but one-quarter of a mind. If we had to divide agencies
into smaller and smaller fragments, each job would end up with no mind
at all!

At first this might seem to be an unusual situation. But it really is
very common. The best way to solve a hard problem is to break it into
several simpler ones, and break those into even simpler ones. Then we
face the same issue of mental fragmentation. Happily, there is another
way. We can work on the various parts of a problem in serial order, one
after another, using the same agency over and over again. Of course,
that takes more time. But it has one absolutely fundamental advantage:
each agency can apply its full power to every subproblem!

The Recursion Principle: When a problem splits into smaller parts, then
unless one can apply the mind's full power to each subjob, one's
intellect will get dispersed and leave less cleverness for each new
task.

Indeed, our minds don't usually shatter into helpless fragments when
problems split into parts. We can imagine how to pack a jewelry box
without forgetting where it will fit into a suitcase. This suggests that
we can apply our full space-arranging resources to each problem in turn.
But how, then, do we get back to the first problem, after we've thought
about the other ones, without having to start all over again? To common
sense the answer seems clear: we simply *remember where we were.* But
this means that we must have some way to store,

and later re-create, the states of interrupted agencies. Behind the
scenes, we need machinery to keep track of all the incomplete
accomplishments, to remember what was learned along the way, to compare
different results, and to measure progress in order to decide what to do
next. All this must go on in accord with larger, sometimes changing
plans.

The need to recall our recent states is why our *short-term memories*
are short-term memories! In order to do their complex jobs so quickly
and effectively, each micromemory-device must be a substantial system of
machinery, with many intricate and specialized connections. If so, our
brains cannot afford to make too many duplicate copies of that
machinery, so we must reuse what we have for different jobs. Each time
we reuse a micromemory-device, the information stored inside must be
erased — or moved to another, less costly place. But that would also
take some time and interrupt the flow of thought. Our short-term
memories must work too fast to have any time for consciousness.
