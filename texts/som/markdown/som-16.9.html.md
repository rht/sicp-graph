*16.9* infant emotions

Some readers may be horrified at picturing a baby's mind as made up of
nearly separate agencies. But we'll never understand how human natures
grow without some theories for how they start. One evidence for
separateness is how suddenly infants switch from smiles of contentment
to shrieks of hunger-rage. In contrast to the complex mixtures of
expressions that adults show, young children seem usually to be in one
or another well-defined state of activity — contentment, hunger,
sleepiness, play, affection, or whatever. Older children show less
sudden mood changes, and their expressions suggest that more different
things are happening at once. Our minds may thus originate as sets of
relatively simple, separate need machines. But soon enough each becomes
enmeshed in all the rest of our growing machinery.

How should we interpret an infant's apparent single-mindedness? One
explanation of those striking shifts in attitude is that one agency
attains control and forcibly suppresses the rest. Another view is that
many processes continue at once — but only one at a time can be
expressed. It would be more efficient to keep the whole array of
proto-specialists at work. Then each would be more ready to assume
control in case of an emergency.

What would be the advantage in a mechanism that makes a baby conceal
that mixture of emotions, expressing only one of them at a time? Perhaps
that artificial sharpening promotes the child's welfare by making it
easier for the parent to respond to whichever problem has the greatest
urgency. It's hard enough to know what infants want, yet think how much
harder it would be if they confronted us with complicated expressions of
mixed feelings! Those infants' very lives — and, in turn, our own lives
— depend upon their expressing themselves clearly. To achieve that
clarity, their agencies must be equipped with powerful cross-exclusion
devices to magnify small differences that make it clear which needs come
first. This leads to simple *summaries* — which manifest themselves as
drastic changes in appearance, voice, and mood that others can interpret
easily. And this is why, under circumstances in which adults merely
frown, babies tend to shriek.

Given that those signs are clear, what forces us to respond to them? To
help their offspring grow, most animals evolve two matching schemes:
communication is a two-way street. On one side, babies are equipped with
cries that can arouse parents far away, out of sight, or sound asleep —
for along with sharpening those signs, cross-exclusion also amplifies
their intensity. And on the other side, adults are made to find those
signals irresistible: there must be special systems in our brains that
give such messages a high priority. To what might those baby-watching
agents be connected? My guess is that they're wired to the remnants of
the same proto-specialists that, when aroused, caused us as infants to
cry in the first place. This leads adults to respond to babies' cries by
attributing to them the same degrees of urgency that we ourselves would
have to feel to make us shriek with similar intensity. This drives the
babies' caretakers to respond to their needs with urgent sympathy.
