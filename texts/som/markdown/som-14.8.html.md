*14.8* the interaction-square
-----------------------------

What's so special about moving left or right or up or down? At first one
might suppose that these ideas work only for motions in a two-
dimensional space. But we can also use this square-like frame for many
other realms of thought, to represent how pairs of causes interact. What
is an interaction, anyway? We say that causes interact if, when
combined, they lead to effects that neither can cause separately. For
example, by combining horizontal and vertical motions, we can move to
places that can't be reached with either kind of motion by itself. We
can represent the effects of such combinations by using a diagram with
labels like those on a compass.

Many of our body joints can move in two independent directions at once —
not the knee, but certainly the wrist, shoulder, hip, ankle, thumb, and
eye. How do we learn to control such complicated joints? My hypothesis
is that we do this by training little interaction-square agencies, which
begin by learning something about each of the nine possible motion
combinations. I suspect that we also base many of our nonphysical skills
on interaction-square arrays because that is the simplest way to
represent what happens when two causes interact. (There is even some
evidence that many sections of the brain are composed of square arrays
of smaller agencies. )

Consider that the Spatial agency in our Society-of-More is not really
involved with space at all, but with interactions between agents like
Tall and Thin. If you were told that one object A is both taller and
wider than another object B, you could be sure that there is *more* of
A. But if you were told that A is taller and thinner than B, you
couldn't be sure which one is *more.* An interaction-square array
provides a convenient way to represent all the possible combinations:

If square-arrays can represent how pairs of causes interact, could
similar schemes be used with three or more causes? That might need too
many *directions* to be practical. We'd need twenty-seven directions to
represent three interacting causes this way, and eighty-one to represent
four. Only rarely, it seems, do people deal with more than two causes at
a time; instead, we either find ways to reformulate such situations or
we accumulate disorderly societies of partially filled
interaction-squares that cover only the most commonly encountered
combinations.
