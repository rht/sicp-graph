*15.4* memories of memories
---------------------------

Ask anyone for memories from childhood, and everyone will readily
produce a handful of stories like this:

My neighbor's father died when I was four. I remember sitting with my
friend in front of their house, watching people come and go. It was
strange. No one said anything.

It's hard to distinguish memories from memories of memories. Indeed,
there's little evidence that any of our adult memories really go way
back to infancy; what seem like early memories may be nothing more than
reconstructions of our older thoughts. For one thing, recollections from
our first five years seem strangely isolated; if we ask what happened
earlier that day, the answer almost always is, *I can't remember that.*
Furthermore, many of those early memories involve incidents so
significant that they probably occupied the child's mind repeatedly over
a period of years. Most suspicious of all is the fact that such
recollections are frequently described as seen through other, older eyes
— with the narrator portrayed inside the scene, right near the center of
the stage. Since we never actually see ourselves, these must be
reconstructed memories, rehearsed and reformulated since infancy.

I suspect that this *amnesia of infancy* is no mere effect of decay over
time but an inevitable result of growing out of infancy. A memory is not
a separate entity, apart from how it works upon the mind. To remember an
early experience, you must be able not only to *retrieve* some old
records, but to reconstruct how your earlier mind reacted to them — and
to do that, you would have to become an infant again. To outgrow
infancy, you have to sacrifice your memories because they're written in
an ancient script that your later selves can no longer read.

We reconstruct our recent memories as well, since they portray less what
we saw than what we recognized. From every moment to the next, your
mental state is shaped not only by signals from the outer world, but by
agents activated by the memories these evoke. For example, when you see
a chair, what makes it appear to you to be a chair — rather than an
assortment of sticks and boards? It must evoke some memories. Only a
part of your impression comes from agents activated directly by your
vision; most of what your higher-level agencies experience comes from
the memories those vision-agents activate. Usually, we have no conscious
sense of this happening, and we never use words like *memory* or
*remembering* when the process works quickly and quietly; instead, we
speak of *seeing* or *recognizing* or *knowing.* This is because such
processes leave too few traces for the rest of the mind to contemplate;
accordingly, such processes are unconscious, because consciousness
requires short-term memory. It is only when a recognition involves
substantial time and effort that we speak of *remembering.*

Then what do we mean by *memory*? Our brains use many different ways to
store the traces of our pasts. No single word can describe so much,
unless it is used only in a general, informal sense.

Memories are processes that make some of our agents act in much the same
ways they did at various times in the past.
