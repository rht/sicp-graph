*19.2* the language-agency
--------------------------

We're normally quite unaware of how our brain-machines enable us to see,
or walk, or remember what we want. And we're equally unaware of how we
speak or of how we comprehend the words we hear. As far as consciousness
can tell, no sooner do we hear a phrase than all its meanings spring to
mind — yet we have no conscious sense of how those words produce their
effects. Consider that all children learn to speak and understand — yet
few adults will ever recognize the regularities of their grammars. For
example, all English speakers learn that saying *big brown dog* is
right, while *brown big dog* is somehow wrong. How do we learn which
phrases are admissible? No language scientist even knows whether brains
must learn this once or twice — first, for knowing what to say, and
second, for knowing what to hear. Do we reuse the same machinery for
both? Our conscious minds just cannot tell, since consciousness does not
reveal how language works.

However, on the other side, language seems to play a role in much of
what our consciousness does. I suspect that this is because our
language-agency plays special roles in how we think, through having a
great deal of control over the memory-systems in other agencies and
therefore over the huge accumulations of knowledge they contain. But
language is only a part of thought. We sometimes seem to think in words
— and sometimes not. What do we *think in* when we aren't using words?
And how do the agents that work with words communicate with those that
don't? Since no one knows, we'll have to make a theory. We'll start by
imagining that the language-system is divided into three regions.

The upper region contains agents that are concerned specifically with
words. The lower region includes all the agencies that are affected by
words. And in the center lie the agencies involved with how words engage
our recollections, expectations, and other kinds of mental processes.
There is also one peculiarity: the language-agency seems to have an
unusual capacity to control its own memories. Our diagram suggests that
this could be because the language-agency can exploit itself as though
it were just another agency.
