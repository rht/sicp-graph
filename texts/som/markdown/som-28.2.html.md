*28.2* magnitude and marketplace
--------------------------------

How can a hurt be canceled by a kiss? How can an insult *add* to injury?
Why do we so often speak as though our wishes and desires were like
forces, which increase one another's effects when they're aligned but
cancel out when they're opposed? I'll argue that this is because, at
every moment of our lives, we're forced to choose between alternatives
we can't compare. Suppose, for example, that you must choose between two
homes: one of them offers a mountain view; the other is closer to where
you work. It really is a strange idea that two such unrelated things as
nearness to work and beautiful scenery could be compared at all. But a
person could instead assess that pleasant, restful view as worth a
certain amount of travel time. Instead of comparing the items
themselves, you could simply compare how much time they seem to be
worth.

We turn to using quantities when we can't compare the qualities of
things.

This way, for better or for worse, we often assign some magnitude or
price to each alternative. That tactic helps to simplify our lives so
much that virtually every social community works out its own communal
measure-schemes — let's call them currencies — that let its people work
and trade in harmony, even though each individual has somewhat different
personal goals. The establishment of a currency can foster both
competition and cooperation by providing us with peaceful ways to divide
and apportion the things we have to share.

But who can set prices on things like time or measure the values of
comfort and love? What makes our mental marketplaces work so well when
emotional states seem so hard to compare? One reason is that no matter
how different those mental conditions seem, they must all compete for
certain limited resources — such as space, time, and energy — and these,
to a rather large extent, are virtually interchangeable. For example,
you'd end up with essentially the same result whether you measure things
in terms of food or time — because it takes time to find food, and each
amount of food helps you survive for some amount of time. Thus the value
we place on each commodity constrains, to some extent, the values we'll
assign to many other kinds of goods. Because there are so many such
constraints, once a community sets up a currency, that currency takes on
a life of its own, and soon we start to treat our *wealth* as though it
were a genuine commodity, a real substance that we can use, save, lend,
or waste.

In a similar way, a group of agencies inside the brain could exploit
some *amount* to keep account of their transactions with one another.
Indeed agencies need such techniques even more than people do, because
they are less able to appreciate each other's concerns. But if agents
had to *pay their way,* what might they use for currency? One family of
agents might evolve ways to exploit their common access to some chemical
that is available in limited quantities; another family of agents might
contrive to use a quantity that doesn't actually exist at all, but whose
amount is simply *computed.* I suspect that what we call the pleasure of
success may be, in effect, the currency of some such scheme. To the
extent that success is interchangeable with time or food or energy, it's
useful to treat pleasure as equivalent to wealth.
