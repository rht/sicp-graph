*11.2* the shape of space
-------------------------

The brain is imprisoned inside the skull, a silent, dark, and motionless
place; how can it learn what it's like outside? The surface of the brain
itself has not the slightest sense of touch; it has no skin with which
to feel; it is only connected to skin. Nor can a brain see, for it has
no eyes; it only is connected to eyes. The only paths from the world to
the brain are bundles of nerves like those that come in from the eyes,
ears, and skin. How do the signals that come through those nerves give
rise to our sense of *being in* the outside world? The answer is that
this sense is a complicated illusion. We never actually make any direct
contact with the outside world. Instead, we work with models of the
world that we build inside our brains. The next few sections try to
sketch how that could come about.

The surface of the skin contains countless little touch-sensing agents,
and the retina of the eye includes a million tiny light detectors.
Scientists know a good deal about how these sensors send signals to the
brain. But we know much less about how those signals lead to sensations
of touch and of sight. Try this simple experiment:

Touch your ear.

What did that feel like? It seems impossible to answer that because
there's scarcely anything to say. Now try a different experiment:

Touch your ear twice, in two different places, and also touch your nose.

Which two touches feel most similar? That question seems much easier to
answer: one might say that the two ear touches feel more similar.
Evidently, there is scarcely anything that one can say about a *single
sensation* by itself, but we can often say much more when we can make
comparisons.

Consider the analogy to how mathematics treats a *perfect point.* We
shouldn't speak about its shape; it simply doesn't have a shape! But
since we're used to things as having shapes,

we can't help thinking of points as round, like *very tiny little dots.*
Similarly, we're not supposed to talk about the size of a point — since
mathematical points, by definition, have no size. Still, we can scarcely
help but think, in any case, *they're very small.* In fact, there's
absolutely nothing to be said about a single point, except how it
relates to other points. This is not because such things are too
complicated to explain, but because they are too simple to explain. One
cannot even speak about where a point is, by itself — since *where* has
meaning only in relation to other points in space. But once we know some
pairs of points, we can relate these to the lines that connect them, and
then we can define new, different points where various pairs of lines
may intersect. Repeating this can generate entire worlds of geometry.
Once we understand the terrifying fact that points are nothing by
themselves but exist only in relation to other points, then we can ask,
as Einstein did, whether time and space are anything more than vast
societies of nearnesses.

In the same way, there is little that one could say about any *single
touch* — or about what any single sense-detecting agent does. However,
there is much more to be said about the relations between two or more
skin touches, because the closer together two skin spots are, the more
frequently they'll both be touched at the same time.
