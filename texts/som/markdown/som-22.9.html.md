*22.9* pronouns and references
------------------------------

We sometimes think of words like *who* or *it* as *pronouns* — that is,
signals that represent or substitute for other nouns or phrases. But as
we've seen, pronouns don't refer to words so much as to partial states
that are active in the listener's mind. In order to *refer* to such an
activity, the listener must assign it to some short-term memory- unit —
that is, to some pronome. However, communication will fail unless the
listener can correctly guess which pronome the speaker wishes to assign
to that activity. This can be a problem when there is more than one
available choice. For example, consider the pronoun *it* in the
following sentence:

The thief who took the moon moved it to Paris.

How does the listener understand that it must mean the moon? English
grammar constrains the choice: it cannot be assigned to the thief
because it cannot refer to a person at all. (We apologize to all the
small children we have called *it* in this book.) But grammar alone
can't determine the choice, since *it* could also mean the sun, as it
does in this little dialogue:

Good grief; what's happened to the sun? Oh, that! The thief who took the
moon moved it to Paris.

The way *it* works is not so much grammatical as psychological. The
expression *moved it* causes the listener's language-agencies to seek a
pronome that represents something that could have been moved. This could
be either the sun or the moon. But the previous question, What happened
to the sun? has already prepared the listener to expect to hear about an
action whose Object pronome represents the sun, just as our earlier
question about cotton made the listener anticipate an answer concerning
that topic. Furthermore, the new phrase, *The thief . . . moved it,*
fulfills this expectation by activating a Trans- frame whose Actor and
Action pronomes already have assignments; this frame requires only an
Object to be complete. So the word *it* is perfectly suited to fill the
role of *sun* in that unassigned Object slot.

What does *expectation* mean? At each point in a dialogue, both parties
are already involved with various concerns and desires. These establish
contexts in which each new word, description, or representation, however
ambiguous, gets merged with whichever short-term memory best matches it.
Why do we make such assignments so quickly, instead of waiting until all
the ambiguities are resolved? That is a practical matter. Our
language-agencies must dispose of each phrase as soon as possible, so
that they can apply their full capacities to deal with what comes
afterward. If something in the conversation does not match anything that
came before, the listener must activate a new memory-unit. This tends to
slow the process down, because it consumes our limited supplies of
short-term memory and makes subsequent matching more difficult. If the
listener cannot make suitable assignments quickly enough, the
conversation will seem incoherent and communication will break down.

Eloquent speakers avoid this by designing each new expression to be
easily attached to structures already active in the listener; otherwise
the listener is entitled to complain that the language isn't clear. A
speaker can also indicate which subjects have not been mentioned yet,

to spare the listener from struggling to make a nonexistent match; we
use expressions like *by the way* to tell the listener not to attach
what comes next to any presently active pronome. To do such things, the
speaker must anticipate some of what is happening inside the listener's
mind. The next section describes a way of doing this — by using the
speaker's own mind as a model and assuming that the listener will be
similar.
