*8.3* mental states and dispositions
------------------------------------

Many modern scientists think it quaint to talk about *mental states.*
They feel this idea is too *subjective* to be scientific, and they
prefer to base their theories of psychology on ideas about information
pro- cessing. This has produced many good theories about problem
solving, pattern recognition, and other important facets of psychology,
but on the whole it hasn't led to useful ways to describe the workings
of our dispositions, attitudes, and feelings.

Is this because, as many think, our feelings are inherently more
complicated than the things we more easily describe in words? Not
necessarily: our memories of attitudes and feelings could come from
relatively simple K-line mechanisms — yet still be inexpressible. This
is because K-lines can easily record relatively widespread and diffuse
activities and, later, reactivate them all at once. This helps explain a
familiar psychological phenomenon:

The experiences we find easiest to recollect are often just the kinds we
find the hardest to describe.

For example, a novice can remember how it felt to be at a concert. A
more proficient amateur can remember more of the music itself — the
rhythms and the harmonies and melodies. But only skilled musicians can
recall the smaller details of timbre, texture, and arrangement. Why do
we find it easier to recollect our attitudes and feelings than to
describe what actually took place? That's just what we should expect
from memories of the K-line kind. Suppose that a certain sentiment or
disposition involved the activities of many different agents. It would
be easy to construct a huge K-line with which we could, later, make
ourselves approximately reexperience that complicated state — simply by
rearousing the same activities. But this would not automatically enable
us to describe those feelings, which is another matter entirely, because
it would require us to summarize that huge, dispersed activity in terms
of some much more compact arrangement of verbal expressions.

We cannot always judge the complexity of our mental states by how easily
we can express them in words. A certain state of mind might involve a
mass of information simply too enormous and diverse to express in any
small number of words, yet not be very complicated in any interesting
sense. Furthermore, the things we can express in words are, to a large
extent, constrained by the social process through which we learn to use
those words. In order for a word to have a predictable effect on other
persons, we must maintain strict, public discipline on how that word is
used — whereas each individual's private, internal signals need not be
so constrained. The signals that come from our nonverbal agents can have
K-line connections that branch out very rapidly to arouse other agents.
If each member of such a society were to arouse a mere hundred others,
then in only three or four steps the activity of a single one of them
could affect a million other agents.

Once we think in terms of K-line memories, it becomes easy to imagine,
at least in principle, how a person could recall a general impression of
a complex previous experience — but it becomes hard to understand how a
person can so easily comprehend a specific statement like *John has more
candy than Mary.* If this theory is correct, the traditional view must
be upside down, which regards it as easy to understand how minds can
deal with *facts* and *propositions,* but hard to see how minds could
have diffuse, hard-to-express dispositions.
