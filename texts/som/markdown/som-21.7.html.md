*21.7* generalizing with pronomes
---------------------------------

From every moment to the next, a person's state of mind is involved with
various objects, topics, goals, and scripts. When you hear the words of
the sentence, *Put the apple in the pail,* somehow this causes the
subjects of *apple,* *pail* and *putting in* to *occupy your mind.*
Later we'll speculate about how these become assigned to appropriate
roles. Here, to make the story short, let's just assume that at a
certain point the language-agency interprets the verb *put* to activate
a certain Trans-frame and to assign the apple-neme to the Object pronome
of that Trans-frame. The automatic *finding machine* described earlier
then assigns the apple's location to the Origin pronome. Similarly, the
pail's location is assigned to the Destination pronome. (As for the
Instrument pronome, this is assigned to the listener's hand by default.)
Now each entity *on the listener's mind* is represented by one or
another pronome assignment. We're almost done, except that in order to
actually perform the imagined action, we need some kind of control
process to activate the proper agencies in the proper sequence!

Activate apple-neme, Look-for, and Move. Then activate Grasp. Activate
pail-neme, Look-for, and Move. Then activate Ungrasp.

This suggests a way to learn a skill. The first few times you try to do
something new, you must experiment to find which agents to activate, and
at what times, and for how long. Later, you can prepare a script that
will do the job more quickly and easily by accumulating memories of
which agent-activations were successful, together with memories of which
polynemes were assigned to various pronomes at those moments. For
example, if you were to *play back* the *Trans-script* shown above, your
arm would find and put a second apple in that pail — without invoking
any higher-level agencies at all! However, this script has a dreadful
limitation: it will work only to put apples into pails. What if you
later wished to put a block into a box or a spoon into a bowl? We could
do that by dividing the process into two scripts: a *pronome-assignment
script* and an *action script.*

Assignment Script: Assign the apple-neme to the Origin pronome. Assign
the pail-neme to the Destination pronome.

Action Script: Activate Origin. Then turn on Look-for, Move, and Grasp.
Activate Destination. Then turn on Look-for, Move, and Ungrasp.

Now notice that the action script never actually mentions the apple or
pail at all but refers only to the pronomes that represent them. Thus
the same action script will serve as well for putting a block into a box
as for putting an apple into a pail!
