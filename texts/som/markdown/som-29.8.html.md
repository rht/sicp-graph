*29.8* metaphors
----------------

Listen closely to anything anyone says, and soon you'll hear analogies.
We speak of time in terms of space, as like a fluid that's running out;
we talk of our friends in physical terms, as in *Mary and John are very
close.* All of our language is riddled and stitched with curious ways of
portraying things as though they belonged to alien realms.

We sometimes call these *metaphors,* our ways to transport thoughts
between the various mental realms. Some metaphors seem utterly
pedestrian, as when we speak of *taking steps* to cause or prevent some
happening. Other metaphors seem more miraculous, when unexpected images
lead to astonishing insights — as when a scientist solves a problem by
conceiving of a fluid as made of tubes or of a wave as an array of
overlapping, expanding spheres. When such conceptions play important
roles in our most productive forms of thought, we find it natural to
ask, *What is a metaphor?* But we rarely notice how frequently we use
the same techniques in ordinary thought.

What, then, is a metaphor? It might be easy to agree on functional
definitions like *A metaphor is that which allows us to replace one kind
of thought with another.* But when we ask for a structural definition of
*metaphor,* we find no unity, only an endless variety of processes and
strategies. Some are simple, as when we make an analogy by stripping
away so many details that two different objects seem the same. But other
forms of metaphor are as complex as can be. In the end there is little
to gain by cloaking them all under the same name *metaphor,* because
there isn't any boundary between metaphorical thought and ordinary
thought. No two things or mental states ever are identical, so every
psychological process must employ one means or another to induce the
illusion of sameness. Every thought is to some degree a metaphor.

Once scientists like Volta and Ampere discovered how to represent
electricity in terms of the pressures and flows of fluids, they could
transport much of what they already knew about fluids to the domain of
electricity. Good metaphors are useful because they transport uniframes,
intact, from one world into another. Such cross-realm correspondences
can enable us to transport entire families of problems into other
realms, in which we can apply to them some already well-developed
skills. However, such correspondences are hard to find since most
reformulations merely transform the uniframes of one realm into
disorderly accumulations in the other realm.

From where do we obtain our most productive, systematic, cross- realm
correspondences? Some must be virtually born into our brains through the
wiring of our paranomes; other metaphors we discover by ourselves as
individuals; but most of them are learned from other members of our
cultural communities. Finally, from time to time, someone discovers a
new reformulation that is both so fruitful and so easy to explain that
it becomes part of the general culture. Naturally, we'd like to know how
the greatest metaphorical discoveries were made. But because this is
buried in the past, the best and rarest of those events may never be
explained at all. Our greatest ideas, like our evolutionary genes, need
form only once, by accident, and then can spread from brain to brain.
