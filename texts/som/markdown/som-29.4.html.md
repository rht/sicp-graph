*29.4* cross-realm correspondences
----------------------------------

We often describe the things we like as *elevated,* *lofty,* or
*heavenly.* Why do we see such things in terms of altitude in space? We
often speak of time itself in spatial terms, as though the future were
*ahead* of us while the past remains behind. We think of problems as
*obstacles* to go around and turn to using diagrams to represent things
that don't have shapes at all. What enables us to turn so many skills to
so many other purposes? These tendencies reflect the systematic
*cross-realm correspondences* embodied in our families of polynemes and
paranomes.

At each instant, several realms may be engaged in active processing.
Each has separate processes but must compete for control of the
ascending nemes that lead into the language- agency. Which polyneme will
play the role of Origin in the next sentence-frame? Will it be Mary's
physical arm or hand, or Mary's social role as party guest? It sometimes
seems

as though the language-agency can focus on only one realm at a time.

This could be one reason why language scientists find it hard to
classify the roles words play in sentence-frames. No sooner does a
language-agency assign some polynemes and isonomes to a phrase than
various mind divisions proceed to alter how they're used inside each
different realm. Every shift of control from one realm to another
affects which particular nemes will be next to influence the
language-agency. This causes moment-to-moment changes in the apparent
meaning of a phrase.

At one moment, control over language may reside in the realm of thought
that is working most successfully; at the next moment, it may be the one
experiencing the most difficulty. Each shift in attention affects how
the various expressions will be interpreted, and this in turn can affect
which realm will next take center stage.

For example, the sentence *Mary gives Jack the kite* might start by
arousing a listener's concern with Mary's social role as party guest.
That would cause the pronomes of a social-frame to represent Mary's
obligation to bring a present. But then the listener's possession realm
might become concerned with Mary's ownership of that gift or with how
she got control of it. This shift from social to possessional concern
could then affect the processing of future sentences. For example, it
will influence whether a phrase like *Jack's kite* is interpreted to
refer to the kite that Jack happens to be holding or to a different kite
that Jack happens to own.

Every mental realm accumulates its own abilities but also discovers,
from time to time, how to exploit the skills of other realms. Thus the
mind as a whole can learn to exploit the frames developed in the realm
of space both for representing events in time and for thinking about
social relationships. Perhaps our chaining skills are the best example
of this; no matter which realm or realms they originate in, we
eventually learn to apply them to any collection of entities, events, or
ideas (in any realm whatever) that we can arrange into sequences. Then
chains assume their myriad forms, such as spatial order, psychological
causality, or social dominance.
