heredity and environment {#heredity-and-environment .appendix}
------------------------

Sometimes we ask why people are so similar. At other times, we wonder
why they differ so much from one to the next. Often we try to classify
our differences into those with which we're born and those we later
learn — and then we find ourselves arguing about which virtues are
inherited, and which we acquire from experience. Most arguments about
*nature vs. nurture* are based on two mistakes. One is to talk about
intelligence as though a person's quality of mind were like a quantity
one could pour into a cup. The other mistake is to assume that there is
a clear distinction between what we learn and how we learn — as though
experience had no effect on how we learn.

Chance plays a major role in human differences, because each of us
starts out by drawing lots from among our parents' genes. A gene is a
unit of heredity — a specific chemical whose structure affects some
aspects of the construction of the body and the brain. We inherit each
of our genes from one parent or the other, more or less by chance, so as
to receive about half of each parent's genes. Within the population as a
whole, each particular kind of gene has variants that work in somewhat
different ways, and there are so many possible combinations of these
alternative genes that every child is born unique — except in the case
of identical twins, who carry identical copies of genes. One thing that
makes people both so different and so similar is this: we are similar
because those alternative genes are usually quite similar — and we are
different because those genes are not identical.

Every cell of the body contains identical copies of all of that person's
genes. But not all genes are active at the same time — and this is why
the cells in our different organs do different things. When a particular
gene is *turned on* inside a cell, that cell manufactures copies of a
particular chemical (called a protein), whose structure is determined by
the structure of that gene. Proteins are used in many ways. Some of them
are assembled into permanent structures, some are involved in
manufacturing other chemicals, and certain proteins move around in the
cell, to serve as messages that alter other processes. Since certain
combinations of these messages can turn other genes on and off, the
gene-constructed chemicals in cells can act like small societies of
agencies.

Every cell has windows in its walls and special genes that control which
chemicals can enter or leave through those windows. Then, certain of
those chemicals can act as messages that change the states of specific
genes in other cells. Thus groups of cells can also be societies. The
effects of most of those messages between cells are temporary and
reversible, but some of them can permanently change the character of
other cells by altering the types of messages they can transmit and
receive. In effect, this converts them into other *types* of cells. When
new types of cells are produced this way, certain of them remain in
place, but other types proceed to move and reproduce — to form new
layers, strands, or clumps. Inside the brain, certain types of cells
emit specific chemicals that drift out like scents; this causes certain
other types of mobile cells that are sensitive to those particular
chemicals to sniff out those scents and track them back to their sources
— leaving tubelike trails behind. These traces of the travels of those
migratory cells then form the nerve-bundles that interconnect various
pairs of far-apart brain-agencies. With all this activity, the embryonic
brain resembles a complex animal ecology — which even includes predators
programmed to find and kill the many cells that happen to reach *wrong*
destinations.

All human brains are similar in size and shape but differ in many
smaller respects because of different alternative genes. Why does the
human population support so many variant genes? One reason is that genes
are sometimes altered by accidents. When this happens to a gene that
lies within a reproductive cell — that is, inside an ovum or a sperm —
the change will be inherited. We call this a *mutation.* Most often, a
mutant gene will simply fail to manufacture some vital chemical, and
this will so badly impair the offspring that natural selection will
quickly remove the mutated gene from the population. But occasionally a
mutant gene will endow those offspring with some substantial advantage.
Then natural selection will spread copies of that gene so widely among
the population that its predecessor gene becomes extinct. Finally, a
variant gene may provide an advantage only in certain circumstances;
this type of mutation may spread only to a certain proportion of the
population, and both the new and the old variants will continue to
coexist indefinitely. The richness of this reservoir of alternative
genes can determine how quickly a population adapts to changes in
ecological conditions — and thus determines whether the entire species
can escape extinction over longer periods of time.

Now let's return to what genes do. Not all genes turn on at once; some
start early and some start late. In general, the sooner a gene starts
working, the greater its effect on what comes afterward. Accordingly, it
is the early-starting genes that most affect the basic, large-scale
architecture of our bodies and our brains. A mutation in an
early-working gene is likely to cause such a drastic alteration of an
animal's basic architecture that the embryo will not survive to be born,
grow up, and reproduce successfully. Accordingly, most mutations of
early-working genes are swiftly weeded out of the population by natural
selection. Mutations in later-starting genes tend to cause less drastic
differences, hence are not so swiftly weeded out and can accumulate in
the population — for example, as variations in the genes that affect the
sizes of connections between various brain-agencies. Every different
combination of such variant genes produces a person with a somewhat
different brain.

The early-starting genes thus frame the large-scale outlines of the
brain — and their uniformity explains why people are so similar on the
broadest scale. These must be the genes responsible for what we call
*human nature* — that is, the predispositions every normal person
shares. Generally, the uniformity of early-starting genes is what makes
all the members of each animal species seem so similar; indeed, it is
partly why the earth is populated with distinct, recognizable species
like lions, turtles, and people, rather than with an indistinct
continuum of all conceivable animals. No human mother ever bears a cat,
since that would require too many different early-starting genes.

the genesis of mental realms {#the-genesis-of-mental-realms .appendix}
----------------------------

All normal children come to recognize the same sorts of physical
objects. Is that because the concept of an object is innate in the human
mind? Each of us becomes attached to certain other individuals. Does
this mean that the concept of person, and the notion of love, are part
of our inheritance? Every human child forms *realms of thought* that
represent the physical, possessional, and psychological. But how could
genes build concepts into minds when genes themselves are merely
linked-together chemicals?

The problem is that thoughts proceed on levels so far removed from those
of chemicals. This makes it hard for genes, which are merely chemicals,
to represent such things as objects, persons, or ideas — at least in
anything like the way that strings of words express our thoughts. Then
how do genes encode ideas? The answer lies in the concept of
*predestined learning* discussed in section 11.7. Although groups of
genes cannot directly encode specific ideas, they can determine the
architecture of agencies that are destined to learn particular kinds of
processes. To illustrate this principle, we'll outline the architecture
of an agency destined to learn to recognize a human individual.

When we first introduced the concept of a recognizer, we suggested a
simple way to represent a physical object in terms of properties like
color, texture, size, and shape — by combining evidence from several
agencies, each containing sensors especially designed to react to
certain particular properties. Now we'll take another step, by dividing
each of those agencies into two sections that are similar in
architecture, and which both receive sensory inputs from the eyes, ears,
skin, and nose. The first system is destined, as before, to learn to
represent physical objects in terms of simple properties. However,
because the second system's inputs come from different types of agents,
it is destined to learn to represent *social objects* — that is, people.

![](./illus/appendix/Appendix-1.png){.illus}

Our second *social object* agency takes all of its inputs from sensors
that detect stimuli which usually signify the presence of a person —
namely, human odors, voices, and faces. Because of this — and even
though the genes that assemble this system know nothing of people — this
system has no alternative but to learn to represent relations among the
features of human individuals. Accordingly, this agency is destined to
learn to recognize people!

The large-scale outline of this agency poses no engineering mystery —
but we have to ask how genes could produce the sensory detectors that
the system needs to do its job. There is ample evidence that the
recognition of both voices and faces does indeed take place in special
sections of the brain — since certain injuries of the brain leave their
victims unable to distinguish voice sounds yet still able to recognize
many other kinds of sounds, while other brain injuries destroy the
ability to recognize faces but leave other visual functions intact. No
one yet knows just how these recognition-systems work, but let's
consider each in turn.

ODOR RECOGNITION: It is easy to build recognizers for particular odors
because an odor is merely the presence of a certain combination of
chemicals in the air, and a specific gene can make a cell sensitive to a
particular chemical. So, to build agents for recognizing the odors of
particular objects or people requires little more than connecting a
variety of evidence-weighing

agents to a variety of specific chemical detectors. VOICE RECOGNITION:
To distinguish the sounds of a human voice requires more machinery
because vocal expressions are complicated sequences of events. Machines
have been built that can make such distinctions. FACE RECOGNITION: No
one has yet been able to build vision machines that approach our human
ability to distinguish faces from other objects — or even to distinguish
dogs from cats. This remains a problem for research.

In their first few days, human infants learn to distinguish people by
their odors; then, over the next few weeks, they learn to recognize
individuals by sound of voice; only after several months do they start
to reliably distinguish the sights of faces. Most likely we learn to
make each of these distinctions by several different methods, and it is
probably no accident that these abilities develop in a sequence that
corresponds to their increasing complexity.

gestures and trajectories {#gestures-and-trajectories .appendix}
-------------------------

To recognize a voice or face seems hard enough; how does a child learn
to recognize another person's mental state — of being angry or
affectionate, for example. One way is by distinguishing trajectories.
Just as we learn to interpret certain types of changes as representing
the motions of objects in the physical realm, we learn to classify other
types of changes as signifying mental events; these are what we call
*gestures* and *expressions.* For example, to identify a certain sound
to be a particular language-word, some agencies inside your brain must
recognize that a certain sequence of phonetic features has occurred. At
the same time, other agencies interpret sequences of vocal sounds as
having significance in other realms. In particular, certain types of
vocal sounds are recognized as signifying specific emotional qualities.
For example, people almost universally agree on which expressions seem
most angry or imperative. In general, abruptly changing sounds evoke
alarm — perhaps by inducing the sort of narrowing of interest that comes
with pain; in any case, sudden changes in volume and pitch demand that
we attend to them. In contrast, we react to *gentle* sounds in ways that
people label *positive,* as with affection, love, or reverence; the
smoother time-trajectories do somehow serve to *calm us down,* thus
frequently inducing us to set aside our other interests. It's quite the
same for sight and touch; hostile persons tend to jab and shout, while
friendly people speak and wave with gestures and trajectories that we
perceive as signifying gentleness and tenderness. Indeed, as shown in
Manfred Clynes's book, Sentics, Doubleday, New York, 1978, people show
similar emotional responses to certain types of time-trajectories
regardless of the sensory domain. We consistently identify certain
sudden, jerky types of action patterns as indicating anger — regardless
of whether these are presented as visual motions, as envelopes of voice
sounds, or as pushing, shoving tactile stimuli. In the same way, we
consistently identify certain other, smoother action patterns to
indicate affection. Clynes concludes that at least half a dozen distinct
types of trajectories are universally associated with particular
emotional states. What sort of brain-machinery could cause us to react
in such similar ways to such different kinds of stimuli? I propose a
three-part hypothesis. First, each of our sensory-agencies is equipped
with special agents that detect certain types of time-trajectories.
Second, the outputs of all the agents that detect similar *trajectory
types* in different agencies are connected, through special connection
bundles, to converge upon agents in some central *gesture-recognizing*
agency. Finally, genetically established nerve-bundles run from each
gesture-recognizing agent to a particular infantile *proto-specialist*
of the sort described in section 16. 3.

According to this hypothesis, each sensory-agency contains agents that
are specialized to react to various types of temporal trajectories. For
example, one kind might react only to stimuli that increase slowly and
then decrease quickly; another kind might react only to signals that
increase quickly and decay slowly. Inside the brain, although the
agencies for hearing, sight, and touch lie far apart, the signals from
agents that detect similar trajectories converge on a common agency
composed of evidence-weighing agents.

![](./illus/appendix/Appendix-2.png){.illus}

Notice that the architecture of this system is so similar to that of our
*person-recognizing* agency that the two systems could form parallel
layers; however, the destiny of each central *trajectory-type* agent is
to learn to recognize, not a particular person, but a particular type of
gesture or expression. For example, one such agent might learn to react
in similar ways to a snarl, grimace, or shaken fist — and thus become an
*anger-recognizing* agent whose function is *abstract* in the sense of
being detached from any particular class of sensations.

To be sure, recognizing anger is not the same as comprehending or
sympathizing with anger — nor does merely learning to make such a
recognition, by itself, teach us to identify an *anger-type* trajectory
of another person with our own personal experience of being angry. But
if our genes equip us with connections from particular central
trajectory-type agents to specific *proto-specialist* agencies, then
each particular trajectory-type recognition would tend to activate a
specific kind of emotional reaction.

Some of these connections could endow us with certain *empathies* — for
example, to feel elated upon recognizing another person's joyous
gestures. Other connections could make us become defensive at signs of
aggression — or even aggressive at signs of weakness and withdrawal.
There are innumerable examples, in animal behavior, of particular types
of gestures evoking *instinctive* types of reactions, as when a sudden
motion toward a bird provokes a fear-reaction flight. Surely our human
genes provide us with a great deal of instinctive wiring. However, far
more than any other kind of animal, we also have machinery that can
bridge new agencies across the older ones, so that we can learn to bury
ancient instincts under modern social disciplines.

We've seen how a gene-built agency could predispose us to use trajectory
types to represent emotional and other sorts of states of mind. Once
this is done, higher-level agencies could use the signals from
trajectory-type agents to learn to recognize and represent more complex
successions of mental states. In time, those representations could be
assembled into models we could use for predicting and controlling our
own mental processes. This illustrates how architectures framed by genes
could serve our minds as stepping- stones toward learning how to think
about ourselves.

As soon as you enter a certain room, you may experience the feeling that
you can directly sense its history. Many people attribute such
perceptions to imaginary influences with names like *intuitions,*
*spirits,* *atmospheres,* and *vibrations.* Yet very likely all such
perceptions come from inside the mind of those observers, as various
mental agencies accomplish clever syntheses from clues derived from
features and trajectories. In my view, believing in vibrations and
ghosts diminishes our capabilities for mental growth by diverting
attention from the mind and attributing those abilities to imaginary
entities outside ourselves.

brain connections {#brain-connections .appendix}
-----------------

What possible sort of brain-machine could support a billion-agent
society of mind? The human brain contains so many agencies and
connections that it resembles a great nation of cities and towns, linked
by vast networks of roads and highways. We are born with brain centers
that are specialized for every sense and muscle group: for moving every
eye and limb; for distinguishing the sounds of words, the features of
faces, and all sorts of touches, tastes and smells. We're born with
protospecialists involved with hunger, laughter, fear and anger, sleep,
and sexual activity — and surely many other functions no one has
discovered yet — each based upon a somewhat different architecture and
mode of operation. Thousands of different genes must be involved in
laying out these agencies and the nerve-bundles between them — and those
brain-growth genes must generate at least three kinds of processes.
Those genetic systems first must form the clumps and layers of brain
cells that eventually become groups of agents; they must dictate the
inner workings of those agencies; and, finally, they must determine the
sizes and destinations of the nerve-bundles that interconnect those
agencies — in order to constrain *who talks to whom* within each
mind-society.

Now every population will include some variants among the genes that
shape those highways in the brain, and this must influence their
bearers' potential styles of thought. A person born with unusually
sparse connections between the agencies for sight and speech might
develop powerful machinery in both those realms but find it hard to make
direct connections between them. On the surface, that might seem to
constitute a disability. However, it might also lead to an advantage —
if it served to force one's higher-level agencies to seek out indirect
connections that lead to more articulate ways to represent reality.
Similarly, one might suppose there would be advantages in having an
uncommonly large capacity for short-term memory. Yet for all we know,
our evolution has disfavored that because it tends to lead to less
effective use of hard-learned long-term memories. Other differences in
how we think could stem from variations in connection paths. An
individual whose K-lines had more branches than usual might become
inclined to assemble larger-than-usual accumulations in cases where a
person whose memory-agents had fewer branches might be more disposed
toward building uniframes. But the same genetic disposition can lead to
different styles of thought: one person who is genetically disposed
toward making uniframes might succumb to the chronic use of superficial
stereotypes, while another person similarly endowed might compensate by
building more deeply layered agencies that lead to more profound ideas.
Although each particular variation will dispose each individual toward
certain traits of personality, the final effect of any gene depends upon
how it interacts with the structures built by other genes — and upon
countless other accidents. This makes it almost meaningless to ask which
particular genes lead to *good* forms of thought. It is better to think
of a developing brain as a forest within which many different creatures
grow, in conflict and in harmony.

Let's return to the architecture of machines that could hold societies
of mind. How complicated this must be depends in part upon how many
agents must be active at each moment. We can clarify the problem by
considering two extremes. If only a few agents need to work at any time,
then even an ordinary, serial, one-step-at-a-time computer could support
billions of such agents — because each agent could be represented by a
separate computer program. Then the computer itself could be quite
simple, provided it has access to enough memory to hold all those little
programs. On the other hand, no such arrangement would suffice to
simulate societies of mind in which each of billions of agents
constantly interact with all the others, all at once, because that would
need more wires than any animal could carry in its head. I suspect that
the human brain works somewhere in between; we do indeed have billions
of nerve cells working at the same time, but relatively few of them have
any need to communicate with more than a small proportion of the rest;
this is simply because most agents are too specialized to deal with many
types of messages. Accordingly, we'll propose an architecture that lies
between those serial and parallel extremes — namely, a compromise in
which a typical agent has comparatively few direct connections to other
agents but can still influence a great many other agents through several
indirect steps. For example, we can imagine a society in which each of a
billion agents is connected to thirty other agents, selected at random.
Then most pairs of agents should be able to communicate through merely
half a dozen intermediates! This is because a typical agent can reach
thirty others in one step, a thousand others in two steps, and a million
others in only four steps. Thus a typical agent could reach any of the
other billion agents in only six or seven steps!

However, randomly selected connections would not be very useful, because
very few randomly selected pairs of agents would have any messages that
might be useful to one another. When we actually examine the human
brain, we find that connections between cells are not made either
uniformly or randomly. Instead, within any typical small region, we see
a great many direct connections between nearby cells but only a
relatively small number of bundles of connections to other regions of
cells that lie farther away. Here is an idealized representation of this
arrangement:

![](./illus/appendix/Appendix-3.png){.illus}

An embryonic brain might assemble such a structure by repeating a
sequence of cell divisions and migrations perhaps half a dozen times. If
only that were done, the resulting structure would be uselessly
repetitive. However, in a real brain's growth, this underlying building
plan is modified at every step by many other processes, and this
produces many agencies that are similar in general form but different in
specific details. Some of these gene-controlled interventions modify the
properties of specific layers and clumps of cells, and this determines
the internal workings of particular agencies. Other interventions affect
the sizes and destinations of the nerve-bundles that interconnect
particular pairs of agencies. Such highway-routing processes could be
used, for example, to lead the nerves that emerge from the
trajectory-type sensors in different agencies to the same central
destination. This would be quite easy to arrange because the trajectory
agents of similar types would tend to have similar genetic origins — and
that would predispose them to be able to *smell* the same varieties of
embryonic message chemicals and thus grow toward the same destination.

The same genetic argument can be applied to other aspects of a child's
development — for example, to why all children seem to grow such similar
Societies-of-More. When we discussed Jean Piaget's experiments, we left
it as a mystery how children form the agencies called History and
Appearance. What leads all those different minds to similar conceptions
of comparisons? In section 10.7 we hinted that this might happen because
similar agents like Tall and Thin originate in related sections of the
brain. Consider that despite the fact that we do not know the
brain-machinery for agents like Tall and Thin, we can be virtually sure
that they are similar internally, because they both respond to the same
sorts of spatial differences. Therefore, they almost surely have a
common evolutionary origin and are constructed by the same or similar
genes. Consequently, the embryonic brain cells that form these agents
will tend to have similar *senses of smell* and are therefore likely to
send out nerves that converge upon the same (or similar) agencies. From
this point of view, the formation of a Spatial agency on which such
properties converge need not be an unlikely chance event, but could be
virtually predestined by inheritance.

Papert's principle requires many agencies to grow by inserting new
layers of agents into older, already working systems. But this poses a
problem because, once brain cells reach maturity, they no longer have
much mobility. Consequently, adding new layers to old agencies must
involve using brain cells in other locations. As far as we know, the
only way this could be done is by using connections already available in
the neighborhood of the original agency. Here's one way embryonic cells
could provide frameworks for future multilayered mind-societies:

![](./illus/appendix/Appendix-4.png){.illus}

Any agency that is potentially capable of expanding to assimilate a
lifetime of experience would need more space than any clump or layer of
cells could provide in any compact neighborhood. This must be why the
cerebral cortex — the newest and largest portion of the brain — evolved
its convoluted form.

![](./illus/appendix/Appendix-5.png){.illus}

If the connections in the cortex of the brain develop this way, through
sequences of cell migrations, it could provide each local neighborhood
with potential access to several other areas, through fanlike bundles
and arrays of nerves. I have the impression the human cortex becomes
thus folded upon itself perhaps five or six times, so that agents in
each neighborhood have potential access to several other levels of
convolution. This makes it possible for a typical agent to become
connected to millions of other agents through only a few indirect
connections. Presumably, only a small minority of cells ever actually
acquire many such connections for their own exclusive use; however, such
an arrangement makes any particular group of cells potentially capable
of acquiring more significance — for example, by gaining control of a
substantial bundle of connections that comes to represent some useful
microneme. In its evolutionary course of making available so many
potential connections, the human brain has actually gone so far that the
major portion of its substance is no longer in its agencies but
constitutes the enormous bundles of nerve fibers that potentially
connect those agencies. The brain of Homo sapiens is mainly composed of
cabling.

survival instinct {#survival-instinct .appendix}
-----------------

Many people seem to think that living things are born endowed with
built-in instincts to survive. And certainly all animals do many things
to stay alive. They build defenses against threats; they reproduce at
any cost; they shy away from extremes of cold or heat, and from
unfamiliarity. Now it usually is sensible, when one sees similarities,
to seek some common cause for them. But I'll argue that it's usually
wrong to seek a common force. There are many different reasons why
animals do many things that help keep them alive — and, as we'll see,
there is even a reason why there are so many different reasons. But to
attribute this to any single, central force or to some basic, underlying
survival instinct is as foolish as believing in special powers that
attract corpses to cemeteries or broken cars to scrapyards.

No animal requires any central reason to survive, nor does the process
of evolution itself require any reason to produce all those survival
aids. On the contrary, evolution's versatility stems from its very lack
of any fixed direction or constraint that might restrict its
possibilities.

To understand why animals survive, one must see evolution as a sieve —
that only passes through its mesh those animals who leave more offspring
than the rest.

Many people also think that evolution favors life — although it is a
painful fact that most mutated animals must die before they reproduce.
But hindsight makes us tend to count only the survivors we see, while
overlooking all the misfits that have disappeared; it is the same
mistake that one might make from looking only at the sky — to then
conclude that all the animals were birds. The animals we see today are
precisely those whose ancestors accumulated a great many survival aids —
and that is why so much of their behavior seems directed toward
promoting their welfare — if only in the surroundings in which their
ancestors evolved. It is an illusion that all those accumulated
mechanisms have anything in common; actually, that seeming uniformity
has no coherence of its own: it is nothing but the shadow of that
evolutionary sieve. The myth of an underlying survival instinct explains
nothing that cannot better be explained without it, and blinds us to the
fact that each of those survival aids may exploit an entirely different
mechanism.

I certainly don't mean to deny that people learn to love life and to
fear death. But this is no simple matter of obeying some elemental
instinct. It involves the development over many years of elaborate
societies of concepts. Nor do I mean to say that people are born without
any instincts at all and must learn everything from experience. On the
contrary, we start with many built-in fragments of machinery, and these
predestine us to learn to shy away from diverse forms of pain,
discomfort, insecurity, and other forms of bodily and mental harm. But
compared to those instinctive fears, the state of nonexistence we call
death is a far more strange and difficult idea, of which no infant can
conceive.

evolution and intent {#evolution-and-intent .appendix}
--------------------

Could animals have evolved as they did, if *nature* had no sense of
goal? A century ago, the world of biologists split in two on one side
stood the *evolutionists,* who held that animals evolve through nothing
more than accidents of chance. Their antagonists were called the
*teleologists*; they disbelieved that such excellent animals could
evolve without any purposeful guidance. The evolutionists turned out to
be right, for now we can watch small animals and plants evolve before
our very eyes and, at a correspondingly slower pace, see similar
developments in creatures that have longer lives. In fact, we can
actually observe how random accidents to genes lead to the selective
survival of particular individuals in various environments — without the
faintest reason to suspect that any goals must be involved. So why do so
many people feel that evolution must have purposes? I suspect that this
belief is based on combining a sound insight about problem solving with
an unsound image of how evolution works. For example, common sense tells
us that a person might never hit upon a design for a flying machine
entirely by trial and error, without having any goals or purposes. This
leads one to suppose that nature, too, must be subject to that same
constraint. The error comes from thinking of *nature* as being concerned
with such problems as finding a way to make animals fly.

The trouble is that this confuses uses with purposes. For example,
suppose one asked how birds evolved, while thoughtlessly assuming that
feathers and wings evolved exclusively for use in flight. One would be
confronted with a formidable problem, since any organ as complex as a
wing would require too many different genes to ever appear by random
chance.

So long as one's mind is fixed on flight, one might feel that the only
solution is to find some flight advantage in each and every earlier
stage that merely produced a protofeather or protowing too small and
weak for actual flight. This is why so many antievolutionists demand
that evolutionary advocates must fill in every imagined *gap* along a
direct path toward a specified goal. However, once we abandon that fixed
idea, it is easier to see how various intermediate developments could
have provided those animals with advantages quite unrelated to flying.
For example, the early ancestors of birds could have accumulated genes
to manufacture various sorts of feathered appendages that helped to wrap
those protobirds in body cloaks that kept them warm. This sort of
fortuitous *preparation* unrelated to any goal of flight would have made
it much more likely that other accidents, perhaps millions of years
later, might have brought a few such elements together to lend some
genuine aerial advantage to an animal already prone to making leaps.

Incidentally, I do not mean to say that evolutionary processes must by
their nature be devoid of purposes. We can actually conceive of how
machinery could exist inside an animal, to purposefully direct some
aspects of its evolution in much the way a farmer can promote the
evolution of chickens that bear more meat or sheep that grow more wool.
Indeed, the reproductive machinery inside our cells has already evolved
so as to produce variations that are more likely to be useful than would
otherwise occur by purely random chance; this idea is explained in a
brilliant essay by Douglas Lenat, entitled *The role of Heuristics in
learning by Discovery,* in Machine Learning: An Artificial Intelligence
Approach, edited by R. Z. Michalski, J. J. Carbonell, and T. M.
Mitchell; Tioga Publishing Co., Palo Alto, Calif., 1983. It is even
conceivable that our genetic systems might even contain some forms of
difference-engine-like machinery that, over very long periods of time,
generate variations in a somewhat purposeful manner. To be sure, this is
mere speculation, since no such system has yet been discovered.

In any case, one aftermath of the controversy with teleologists was that
many scientists in other realms became so afraid of making similar
mistakes that the very concept of purpose became taboo throughout
science. Even today, most scientists regard it as an abomination to use
*anthropomorphic* or *intentional* language in connection with anything
but persons or higher animals. This burdened the science of psychology
with a double-barreled handicap. On one side, it made psychologists
regard many of their most important problems as outside the scope of
scientific explanation. On the other side, it deprived them of many
useful technical ideas — because such concept-words as *want,* *expect,*
and *recognize* are among the most effective ever found for describing
what happens in human minds. It was not until the *cybernetic
revolution* of the 1940s that scientists finally realized there is
nothing inherently unscientific about the concept of goal itself and
that attributing goals to evolution was bad not because it was
impossible, but simply because it was wrong. Human minds do indeed use
goal-machinery, and there is nothing wrong with recognizing this and
bringing technical theories about intentions and goals into psychology.

insulation and interaction {#insulation-and-interaction .appendix}

> The hardest thing to understand is why we can understand  anything at

What hope is there for any human mind to understand a human brain? No
one could ever memorize the whole of all its small details. Our only
hope is in formulating their principles. It wouldn't be much use, in any
case, to know how each separate part works and how it interacts with the
rest — because that simply isn't practical. Even if you knew all those
details, if someone asked you to describe — in general terms — how
brains work and how they change, you would have no way to reply.

We usually like to think in positive terms about how various parts of
systems interact. But to do that, we must first have good ideas about
which aspects of a system do not interact — since otherwise there would
be too many possibilities to consider. In other words, we have to
understand insulations before we can comprehend interactions. To put
this in a stronger form: No complicated society would actually work if
it really depended on interactions among most of its parts. This is
because any such system would be disabled by virtually any distortion,
injury, or environmental fluctuation. Nor could any such society evolve
in the first place.

The science of biology was itself shaped by the discovery of
insulations. Plants and animals were scarcely understood at all until it
was found that they were made of separate cells. Then little more was
learned so long as scientists thought of cells as bags of fluid within
which countless chemicals could freely interact. Today we know that
cells are more like factories, containing systems that are kept apart by
sturdy walls, with doors that open only to those substances that bear
the proper keys. Furthermore, even within these compartments, most pairs
of chemicals cannot interact except by permission of particular genes.
Without those insulations, so many chemicals would interact that all our
cells would die.

For the purposes of this book, I have emphasized highly insulated
systems — that is, mechanisms in which different functions are embodied
in different agents. However, it is important to put this in
perspective. For example, in chapter 19, we drew a sharp distinction
between memorizers and recognizers; this made it easy to explain those
ideas. However, in section 20.9 we mentioned very briefly the idea of a
*distributed memory,* in which both those functions are combined in the
same network of agents. Now I do not want the reader to take the brevity
of that discussion to suggest the subject is not important. On the
contrary, I suspect that most of the human brain is actually composed of
distributed learning-systems and that it is extremely important for us
to understand how they can work. It is possible to combine even more
functions; for example, John Hopfield has demonstrated a single
distributed network that not only combines memory and recognition, but
also *correctly yields an entire memory from any subpart of sufficient
size* — in other words, an agency that *closes the ring,* much as
described in section 19.10. See Hopfield's article in the Proceedings of
the National Academy of Science, 79, p. 2554, 1982, or the book Parallel
Distributed Processing by D. E. Rumelhart and J. L. McLelland, M.I.T.
Press, 1986.

The advantages of distributed systems are not alternatives to the
advantages of insulated systems; the two are complementary. To say that
the brain may be composed of distributed systems is not the same as
saying that it is a distributed system — that is, a single network in
which all functions are uniformly distributed. I do not believe any
brain of that sort could work, because the interactions would be
uncontrollable. To be sure, we have to explain how different ideas can
become connected to one another — but we must also explain what keeps
our separate memories intact. For example, we have praised the power of
metaphors that allow us to combine ideas from different realms — but all
that power would be lost if all our metaphors got mixed! Similarly, the
architecture of a mind-society must encourage the formation and
maintenance of distinct levels of management by preventing the formation
of connections between agencies whose messages have no mutual
significance. Some theorists have assumed that distributed systems are
inherently both robust and versatile, but actually those attributes are
likely to conflict. Systems with too many interactions of different
types will tend to be fragile, while systems with too many interactions
of similar types will be too redundant to adapt to novel situations and
requirements. Finally, distributed systems tend to lack explicit,
articulated representations, and this makes it difficult for any such
agency to discover how any other such agency works. Thus, if distributed
memory-systems are widely used within our brains, as I suspect they are,
that could be yet another reason for the shallowness of human
consciousness.

evolution of human thought {#evolution-of-human-thought .appendix}
--------------------------

What are the origins of human thought? Today, we're almost sure that our
closest living relatives branched out according to the diagram below. It
shows that none of the species that still exist are directly descended
from any of the others, but that they all share common ancestors, now
long extinct.

How different are we human beings from all the other animals? We
recognize how similar those various brains and bodies are. But in view
of our exceptional abilities to speak and think, we certainly seem to be
unique. Could chimpanzees or gorillas ever learn to speak the way we do?
Experience has shown that these wonderful animals can indeed learn to
make connections among hundreds of different words and ideas, enabling
them to produce speechlike strings of symbol- signs for expressing
Trans-actions such as *Put the candy into the box.* However, the same
experiments appear to show that these animals find it much more
difficult to construct language-strings in which the terminals of
certain frames are filled with other filled-in frames. In other words,
no one has succeeded in teaching these animals to use expressions that
involve interruption clauses, such as *Put the candy that is in the pail
into the box.* To be sure, our inability to teach such things does not
prove that these animals are inherently incapable of them. Still, no one
can doubt that we have capabilities our ancestors did not possess. What
sorts of brain developments could have given rise to our new and mighty
forms of thought? Here are some possible candidates:

The capacity to attach new K-lines to old ones enabled us to build
hierarchical memory-trees. The availability of more versatile temporary
memories enabled us to pursue subgoals and to tolerate more complicated
kinds of interruptions. The evolution of paranomes — that is, of
isonomes that bridge across multiple realms — enabled us to examine the
same problem from several viewpoints.

The emergence of additional layers of agents allowed each child to grow
through more stages of development.

None of those advances by itself would seem to pose any special
evolutionary difficulty. But what could have caused so many changes to
have appeared so rapidly? Our ancestors diverged from their relatives,
the gorillas and the chimpanzees, only a few million years ago, and our
human brains have grown substantially in only the last few hundred
thousand years. Little is known of what happened in that interval
because we have found very few fossil remains of our ancestors. (This
could be partly because their population was never very large but could
also be because they had become too smart to permit themselves to be
fossilized.) The evolutionary interval was so brief that most of our
genes and brain structures remain nearly the same as those of the
chimpanzees. Was it merely an increase in the brain's size and capacity
that produced our new abilities? Consider that, by itself, an increase
in the size of the brain might only cause the disadvantage of mental
confusion and the inconvenience of a heavier head. However, if we first
evolved significant advances in the ability to manage our memories, we
could then take advantage of more memory. Similarly, inserting new
layers of agents into old agencies might only lead to bad results —
unless this were preceded by mechanisms for using such layers as
*middle- level managers* without disrupting older functions. In other
words, our evolution must have worked the other way: first came
enhancements in abilities that made it feasible for us to manage larger
agencies. Then, once we had the capability for using more machinery,
natural selection could favor those who grew more massive brains.
