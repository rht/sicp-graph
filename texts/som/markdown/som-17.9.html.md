*17.9* different spans of memories
----------------------------------

> Everyone can master a grief but he who has it. —William Shakespeare

Consider the plight of a mother with a new infant. Her baby will demand
her time for many years. Sometimes she must wonder, *How does this baby
justify such sacrifice?* Various answers come to mind: *Because I love
it.* *Because someday it will care for me.* *Because it's here to carry
on our line.* But reasoning rarely brings answers to such questions.
Usually, those questions simply fade away as parents continue to nurture
their children as though they were parts of their own bodies. Sometimes,
though, strains may overwhelm the mechanisms that protect each child
from harm, and this results in tragedies.

These complex parent-to-child and child-to-parent bonds must be based on
certain types of memory. Some memories are less changeable than others,
and I suspect that attachment-bonds involve memory-records of a type
that can be rapidly formed but then become peculiarly slow to change. On
the child's side, perhaps these bonds are descended from the forms of
learning called *imprinting,* with which many kinds of infant animals
quickly learn to recognize their parents. On the parents' side, the
adult animals of many species will reject infants not involved in
bonding shortly after birth; then foster-parenting becomes impossible.
Why should bonding memories be so hard to change? In animals, there
usually are evolutionary disadvantages to raising the offspring of
unrelated individuals. Human infants must develop under the additional
constraint of requiring constant adult models as a basis for their
personalities. Similar goal-affecting bonds could explain the often
irresistible force of *peer pressure* in later life. Perhaps all such
attachment-bonds exploit the same machinery.

Many animals form other kinds of social bonds as well, like those in
which an individual selects a mate and then remains attached to it for
life. Many people do this, too, and a number of the ones who don't have
been observed to select, instead, from among alternatives of seemingly
similar appearance or character — as though those persons were attached,
if not to individuals, to certain constant prototypes. Other people
frequently find themselves enslaved by infatuations that some parts of
their minds find unwelcome but cannot prevent or overcome; once formed,
those memory-bonds will only slowly fade away. The time spans of our
different sorts of memories evolved to suit, not our own needs, but
those of our ancestors.

We all know the seemingly inexorable time span of mourning, in which it
often takes so long to accept the loss of those we love. Perhaps this,
too, reflects the slowness of attachment-change, though it is only one
factor. This could also be partially responsible for the prolonged
psychological disability that can follow the experience of a physical,
emotional, or sexual assault upon a person. One might ask, since there
are so many other devastating aspects of such an experience, why it
should involve any connection with attachment memory. I suspect that any
form of intimacy, however unwelcome, has effects upon machinery shared
by both attachment and sexuality,

and is liable to disturb or disrupt the machinery with which we make
relationships in ordinary life. No matter how brief that violent
episode, it may lead to long derangements in our usual relationships, in
part because those agencies are slow to change. It doesn't help very
much for the victim to try to view the situation neutrally, because the
rest of the mind cannot control those agencies; only time can
reconstruct their normal functioning. It is an injury more terrible than
loss of sight or limb, to lose the normal use of the agencies with which
one builds one's own identity.
