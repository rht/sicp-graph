*14.1* using reformulation
--------------------------

What can we do when we can't solve a problem? We can try to find a new
way to look at it, to describe it in different terms. Reformulation is
the most powerful way to attempt to escape from what seems to be a
hopeless situation. Thus, when we couldn't find anything common to all
those different kinds of arches, we changed our way of looking at them.
We moved from the world of rigid, geometric block descriptions to a less
constrained domain of body-support descriptions — and there we found a
way to make a uniframe for all of them: a span supported by a pair of
legs. But think of all the other ways a person might describe an arch.

Aesthetic: A pleasing, shapely form. Dynamical: The top will fall if
either leg is removed. Topological: The arch surrounds a hole in space.
Geometrical: The three blocks form an *inverted U* shape. Architectural:
The arch's top could be the base of something else.

Constructional: Place two blocks, then place another across their tops.
Circumventional: Can be used as a detour, to go around an obstacle.
Transportational: Can be used as a bridge, to go from one place to
another.

Each of these involves a different *realm* of thought with its own style
for describing things. And every different realm of thought can bring
new kinds of skills to bear on a problem. We each learn various ways to
reason about paths and obstacles; we each learn ways to deal with
vertical support; with doors and windows; with boxes and bridges and
tunnels; with stacks and rows and stairs and ramps.

To an outsider, it may seem that a creative inventor (or designer or
thinker) must possess an endless source of novel ways to deal with
things. Yet inside the inventor's mind, that all might stem from
variations on far fewer themes. Indeed, in that inventor's view, those
styles of thought may seem so clear (and those inventions all so
similar) that the question turns the other way: *Why can't outsiders
understand how to think about these simple kinds of problems?* In the
long run, the most productive kinds of thought are not the methods with
which we solve particular problems, but those that lead us to
formulating useful new kinds of descriptions.

How do we reformulate? Each new technique presumably begins by
exploiting methods already learned in other, older agencies. So new
ideas often have roots in older ones, adapted for new purposes. In the
next section, we'll see how that body-support idea has counterparts in
virtually every realm of thought. Toward the end of this book, we'll
speculate about how those various realms themselves evolve inside the
mind.

We were able to uniframe many kinds of arches by dividing each into a
Body and a Support. See how well that technique works on many other
sorts of things.

What makes such simple cuts seem meaningful? It is because we can
imagine purposes for each. In everyday life, there is a special
significance to dividing a table into *top* and *legs.* This is because
the tabletop serves our principal use for a table, as *thing to put
things on.* The table's legs serve only secondary purposes: without
those legs, the top would fall — but without its top, the table has no
use at all. And it would make no sense to imagine dividing that table in
half, vertically, to see it as two stuck-together, L-shaped parts.

This must be one reason why the body-support idea seems so universal. It
is not merely a matter of physical support: the more profound idea is
that of building a mental bridge between a thing and a purpose. This is
why bridge-definitions are so useful: they help us connect structural
descriptions to psychological goals. But the point is that it is not
enough just to link together descriptions from two different worlds —
*top supported by legs* and *thing to put things on.* It is not enough
simply to know that tables keep things off the floor. To use that
knowledge, we must also know how it is done: that things have to be put
on the table, rather than, for example, between the table's legs.

This is where the body-support representation helps us to classify our
knowledge. The *body* represents those parts of a structure that serve
as the direct instrument for reaching the goals and the *support*
represents all the other features that merely serve that instrument.
Once we can classify the tabletop as the *body* of the table, we will
tend to think only of using the tabletop for keeping things off the
floor. Of course, we would gain even more power by understanding how
those supports assist the body's goal; that is, by understanding that
the table's legs are for keeping the tabletop itself away from the
floor. A good way to understand that is to have a representation of what
might happen if one of the table's legs failed to perform its function.

To understand how something works, it helps to know how it can fail.
