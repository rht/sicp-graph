*7.10* genius
-------------

We naturally admire our Einsteins, Shakespeares, and Beethovens — and we
wonder if machines could ever create such wondrous theories, plays, and
symphonies. Most people think that accomplishments like these require
*talents* or *gifts* that cannot be explained. If so, then it follows
that computers can't create such things — since anything machines do can
be explained. But why assume that what our greatest artists do is very
different from what ordinary people do — when we know so little about
what ordinary people do! Surely it is premature to ask how great
composers write great symphonies before we know how ordinary people
think of ordinary tunes. I don't believe there is much difference
between normal and *creative* thought. Right now, if asked which seems
the more mysterious, I'd have to say the ordinary kind.

We shouldn't let our envy of distinguished masters of the arts distract
us from the wonder of how each of us gets new ideas. Perhaps we hold on
to our superstitions about creativity in order to make our own
deficiencies seem more excusable. For when we tell ourselves that
masterful abilities are simply unexplainable, we're also comforting
ourselves by saying that those super-heroes come endowed with all the
qualities we don't possess. Our failures are therefore no fault of our
own, nor are those heroes' virtues to their credit, either. If it isn't
learned, it isn't earned.

When we actually meet the heroes whom our culture views as great, we
don't find any singular propensities — only combinations of ingredients
quite common in themselves. Most of these heroes are intensely
motivated, but so are many other people. They're usually very proficient
in some field — but in itself we simply call this craftsmanship or
expertise. They often have enough self-confidence to stand up to the
scorn of peers — but in itself, we might just call that stubbornness.
They surely think of things in some novel ways, but so does everyone
from time to time. And as for what we call *intelligence,* my view is
that each person who can speak coherently already has the better part of
what our heroes have. Then what makes genius appear to stand apart, if
we each have most of what it takes?

I suspect that genius needs one thing more: in order to accumulate
outstanding qualities, one needs unusually effective ways to learn. It's
not enough to learn a lot; one also has to manage what one learns. Those
masters have, beneath the surface of their mastery, some special knacks
of *higher-order* expertise, which help them organize and apply the
things they learn. It is those hidden tricks of mental management that
produce the systems that create those works of genius. Why do certain
people learn so many more and better skills? These all-important
differences could begin with early accidents. One child works out clever
ways to arrange some blocks in rows and stacks; a second child plays at
rearranging how it thinks. Everyone can praise the first child's castles
and towers, but no one can see what the second child has done, and one
may even get the false impression of a lack of industry. But if the
second child persists in seeking better ways to learn, this can lead to
silent growth in which some better ways to learn may lead to better ways
to learn to learn. Then, later, well observe an awesome, qualitative
change, with no apparent cause — and give to it some empty name like
talent, aptitude, or gift.

Finally, an awful thought: perhaps what we call genius is rare because
our evolution works without respect for individuals. Could any tribe or
culture endure in which each individual discovered novel ways to think?
If not, how sad, since the genes for genius might then lead not to
nurturing, but only to frequent weeding-out.
