*17.6* prerequisites for growth
-------------------------------

What controls the pace of mental growth? Although some aspects of
development depend on external circumstances and others seem to happen
only by chance, certain aspects of our growth seem almost to proceed
relentlessly from stage to stage, as though those stages were
predestined. This brings us back to asking why development proceeds in
stages at all.

One reason a skill may grow in steps is that it needs *prerequisites.*
You cannot start to build a house by placing its roof on top; first you
have to build some walls. That's not an arbitrary rule; it's inherent in
the enterprise. It is the same for mental skills; some processes cannot
be learned until certain other processes become available. Many of
Piaget's theories were based on his suspicion that certain concepts had
prerequisites. For example, he argued that a child must possess ideas
about which operations are reversible before that child can grow good
concepts about how quantities are conserved. Hypotheses like these led
Piaget to do his great experiments. But consider how easily those
experiments could have been done a thousand years before; the only
equipment they required were children, water, and various jars. Were
Piaget's ideas prerequisites for conceiving those experiments?

To build a good Society-of-More, it simply would not be practical for a
child to introduce those middle-level agents Appearance and History
until some lower-level agents such as Tall, Thin, No Loss, and
Reversible had become available. Before that stage, there would be
nothing for those managers to do! To be sure, that isn't strictly true,
just as one could start to construct a house with a roof, by using
temporary scaffolding and later building the house's sides. We can never
be absolutely sure of what a skill's prerequisites must be — and this
will always complicate psychology.

The reason we know so little about how children's minds grow is that we
can't observe the processes that are responsible. It could take several
years to refine a new agency, and during that time, the child's behavior
will be dominated by other processes in other agencies, which are
themselves growing through their own, overlapping stages of development.
A serious problem for the psychologist is that certain types of mental
growth can never be directly observed at all. This applies, in
particular, to those all-important *B-brain* processes with which we
learn new ways to learn. Only the indirect products of this ever appear
in the child's actual behavior, and even these may not become overt
until long after that higher-level growth has occurred. Perhaps most
difficult of all is detecting the development of suppressors and
censors. See 27.2. It is hard enough to analyze what people do, but it
is almost impossible to recognize the things they never do.

To make matters worse, many of the *stages of development* that we
actually observe do not really exist. From time to time, each parent has
the illusion that a child has suddenly changed, when this is only the
result of not observing several smaller, real changes in the past. In
such a case, if there exists a *stage of growth,* it is inside the
parent's mind, and not in the child at all!
