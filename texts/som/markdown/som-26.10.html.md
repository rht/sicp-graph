*26.10* learning language
-------------------------

The vocabulary of a language — the words themselves — is the product of
a project that spans the history of a culture and can involve millions
of person years of work. Every sense of every word records some
intellectual discovery that now outlives the myriad other, less
distinguished thoughts that never earned a name.

Each person invents some new ideas, but most of these will die when
their owners do, except for those that make their way into the culture's
lexicon. Still, from that ever-growing reservoir we each inherit many
thousands of powerful ideas that all our predecessors found. Yet it is
no paradox to say that even as we inherit those ideas from our culture,
we each must reinvent them for ourselves. We cannot learn meanings only
by memorizing definitions: we must also *understand* them. Each
situation in which a word is used must suggest some mixture of materials
already in the mind of a listener, who then, alone, must attempt to
assemble these ingredients into something that will work in consonance
with other things already learned. Definitions sometimes help — but
still one must separate the essences from the accidents of the context,
link together structures and functions, and build connections to the
other things one knows.

A word can only serve to indicate that someone else may have a valuable
idea — that is, some useful structure to be built inside the mind. Each
new word only plants a seed: to make it grow, a listener's mind must
find a way to build inside itself some structure that appears to work
like the one in the mind from which it was *learned.*

Along with the words, we also have to learn the grammar-tactics for
using them. Most children start by using only one or two words at a
time. Then, over the next two or three years, they learn to speak in
sentences. It usually takes a full decade to learn most of the
conventions of adult speech, but we often see relatively sudden advances
over concentrated periods of time. How do children learn such
complicated skills so quickly? Some language theorists have suggested
that children learn to use grammar so readily that our brains must be
born with built-in grammar-machinery. However, we've seen that our
visual-systems solve many similar problems in even earlier years — and
we've also seen that when they learn to play with spoons and pails,
children must learn yet other languagelike skills for managing the
Origins, Destinations, Recipients, and Instruments of their actions.
Thus, many sections of our brains appear to demonstrate capacities for
rearranging pronome roles even before we learn to speak. If so, perhaps
we ought not to wonder so much about how children learn to speak so
readily. Instead, we ought to wonder why it takes so long, when they
already do so many similar things inside their heads.
