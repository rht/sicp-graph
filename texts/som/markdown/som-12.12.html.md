*12.12* meaning and definition
------------------------------

What is a meaning? Sometimes we're told a definition of a word, and
suddenly, we know a way to use that word. But definitions do not often
work so well. Suppose you had to explain what *game* means. You could
start like this:

GAME: An activity in which two teams compete to make a ball do something
that results in a winning score.

This fits a certain range of games — but what of games that just use
words, or keep no scores, or lack the element of competition? We can
capture the nature of more kinds of games by using other definitions,
but nothing seems to catch them all. We simply cannot find much in
common to everything we call a game. Yet one still feels there is a
certain unity that underlies the idea of a game. For example, we feel
that we could recognize new games, and that *game* is more than an
arbitrary accumulation.

But now let's turn our attention away from the physical aspects of games
and focus on the psychological purposes that games can serve. Then it is
much easier to find some qualities that are common to most adult games:

GAME: An activity that is engaging and diverting, deliberately detached
from real life.

This second kind of definition treats a game, not as a kind of
object-thing, but as a process in the mind. At first this might seem
somewhat strange, but really it is nothing new — even our first
definition already contained psychological elements, concealed in the
words *competing* and *winning.* When seen this way, different kinds of
games seem much more similar. This is because they all serve common
purposes — despite the great diversity of their physical appearances.
After all, there is virtually no limit to the variety of physical
objects or structures that could be used to accomplish the same
psychological purpose — in this case, to make an activity diverting
(whatever that might mean). Naturally, then, it would be hard to specify
the range of all the possible physical forms of games.

Of course, it is no great surprise to find that *game* has a more
psychological character than does *brick,* which we can define in
physical terms without referring to our goals. But most ideas lie in
between. We saw this in the case of *chair,* which we cannot describe
without referring both to a physical structure and to a psychological
function.
