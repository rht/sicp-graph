*12.8* problems of disunity
---------------------------

When should you accumulate, and when should you make uniframes? The
choice depends upon your purposes. Sometimes it is useful to regard
things as similar because they have similar forms, but sometimes it
makes more sense to group together things with similar uses. At one
moment you may wish to emphasize a similarity; at the next moment, you
may want to emphasize a distinction. Often, we have to use both
uniframes and accumulations in combination. In Block-Arch, for example,
we found that there could be two different kinds of arch tops — the
block and the wedge. Accordingly, when we used the phrase *block or
wedge,* we actually inserted a *subaccumulation* into our uniframe.

Accumulations rarely seem quite satisfactory because we feel ideas
should have more unity. We wouldn't have a word for chair or arch or
currency if they meant nothing more than lists of unrelated things. If
each did not involve some unifying thought, we'd never think to make
those lists in the first place! Why is it so hard to describe their
essences? In the next few sections we'll discover a number of reasons
for this. Here is one of them:

Many good ideas are really two ideas in one — which form a bridge
between two realms of thought or different points of view.

Whenever we build a bridge between structure and function, one end of
that bridge may represent a goal or use, while the other end describes
what we might use to gain those ends. But it is rare for those
structures to correspond neatly to those functions. The problem is that
we usually find many different ways to achieve any goal. This means that
we'll find an accumulation on the structural side of the bridge. For
example, if you want to reach something high up, you can stand on a
chair, reach with a stick, or ask someone taller to get it for you.
Similarly, an accumulation of functions or goals can be found for any
structure. My colleague Oliver Selfridge once wrote an entire book
entitled Things to Do with a Stick.

Our different worlds of ends and means don't usually match up very well.
So when we find a useful, compact uniframe in one such world, it often
corresponds to an accumulation in our other worlds.

We encountered this problem earlier. When we classified birds as animals
while classifying airplanes as machines, we thereby forced disunity upon
the class of things that fly. Later, when we come to theories about
metaphors, we'll see that such problems are almost inevitable because we
know only a very few — and, therefore, very precious — schemes whose
unifying powers cross many realms.
