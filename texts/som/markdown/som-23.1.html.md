*23.1* a world of differences
-----------------------------

Much of ordinary thought is based on recognizing differences. This is
because it is generally useless to do anything that has no discernible
effect. To ask if something is significant is virtually to ask, *What
difference does it make?* Indeed, whenever we talk about *cause and
effect* we're referring to imaginary links that connect the differences
we sense. What, indeed, are goals themselves, but ways in which we
represent the kinds of changes we might like to make?

It is interesting how many familiar mental activities can be represented
in terms of the differences between situations. Suppose you have in mind
two situations A and Z, and D is your description of the difference
between them. Suppose also that you are thinking of applying a certain
procedure P to the first situation, A. There are several kinds of
thinking you might do.

PREDICTING. To the extent that you can predict how various P's will
affect A, you can avoid the expense and risk of actually performing
those actions.

EXPECTING. If you expect P to produce Z but it actually produces Y, then
you can try to explain what went wrong in terms of difference between Y
and Z. EXPLAINING. If actions like P usually lead to differences of type
D, then when you observe such a D, you can suspect that it was caused by
something like P.

WANTING. If you are in situation A, but wish to be in a situation more
like Z, it may help to remember ways to remove or reduce differences
like D. ESCAPING, ATTACKING, and DEFENDING. If P causes a disturbing
type of difference D, we can try to improve matters by finding some
action that counteracts or opposes P. ABSTRACTING. In many forms of
thought, the differences we notice between objects at each level become
the *objects* of our higher-level thoughts.

Not only are differences important by themselves; more often than we
realize, we think about differences between differences. For example,
the *height* of a physical object is really a difference between the
locations of its top and its bottom. And this means that the
higher-level agents in our Societies-of-More must actually deal with
differences between differences. For example, the agent Taller has to
react to the difference between two heights — but as we've just seen, a
height is already a difference between two locations!

The ability to consider differences between differences is important
because it lies at the heart of our abilities to solve new problems.
This is because these *second-order-differences* are what we use to
remind ourselves of other problems we already know how to solve.
Sometimes this is called *reasoning by analogy* and is considered to be
an exotic or unusual way to solve problems. But in my view, it's our
most ordinary way of doing things.
