*7.9* intentions
----------------

When we watch a ball roll down a slope, we notice it seems to try to get
around obstacles that lie in its path. If we didn't know about gravity,
we might be tempted to think that the ball has the goal of moving down.
But we know that the ball isn't *trying* to do anything; the impression
of intention is only in the watcher's mind.

When we experiment with Builder we also get the sense that it has a
goal. Whenever you take its blocks away, it reaches out and takes them
back. Whenever you knock its tower down, it rebuilds it. It seems to
want a tower there, and it perseveres until the tower is done. Certainly
Builder seems smarter than the rolling ball because it overcomes more
complicated obstacles. But once we know how Builder works, we see that
it's not so different from that ball: all it does is keep on finding
blocks and putting them on top of other blocks. Does Builder really have
a goal?

One ingredient of having a goal is persistence. We wouldn't say that
Builder wants a tower, if it didn't keep persisting in attempts to build
one. But persistence alone is not enough — and neither Builder nor that
rolling ball have any sense of where they want to go. The other critical
ingredient of goal is to have some image or description of a wanted or
desired state. Before we'd agree that Builder wants a tower, we'd have
to make sure that it contains something like an image or a description
of a tower. The idea of a difference-engine embodies both elements: a
representation of some outcome and a mechanism to make it persist until
that outcome is achieved.

Do difference-engines *really* want? It is futile to ask that kind of
question because it seeks a distinction where none exists — except in
some observer's mind. We can think of a ball as a perfectly passive
object that merely reacts to external forces. But the eighteenth-
century physicist Jean Le Rond d'Alembert showed that one can also
perfectly predict the behavior of a rolling ball by describing it as a
difference-engine whose goal is to reduce its own energy. We need not
force ourselves to decide questions like whether machines can have goals
or not. Words should be our servants, not our masters. The notion of
goal makes it easy to describe certain aspects of what people and
machines can do; it offers us the opportunity to use simple descriptions
in terms of active purposes instead of using unmanageably cumbersome
descriptions of machinery.

To be sure, this doesn't capture everything that people mean by *having
goals.* We humans have so many ways of wanting things that no one scheme
can embrace them all. Nevertheless, this idea has already led to many
important developments both in Artificial Intelligence and in
psychology. The difference-engine scheme remains the most useful
conception of goal, purpose, or intention yet discovered.
