*6.5* Frozen reflection
-----------------------

No supervisor can know everything that all its agents do. There's simply
never time enough. Each bureaucrat sees but a fraction of what happens
underneath its place in the pyramid of information flow. The best
subordinates are those that work most quietly. Indeed, that's why we
build administrative pyramids for jobs we don't know how to do or don't
have time to do ourselves. It is also why so many of our thoughts must
hide beyond our consciousness.

Good scientists never try to learn too much at once. Instead, they
select particular aspects of a situation, observe carefully, and make
records. Experimental records are *frozen phenomena.* They let us take
all the time we need to make our theories. But how could we do the same
thing inside the mind? We'd need some kind of memory in which to keep
such records safe.

We'll see how this could work when we come to the chapters on memory.
We'll conjecture that your brain contains a host of agents called
*K-lines,* which you can use to make records of what some of your
brain-agents are doing at a certain moment. Later, when you activate the
same K-lines, this restores those agents to their previous states. This
makes you *remember* part of your previous mental state, by making those
parts of your mind do just what they did before. Then, the other parts
of your mind will react as though the same events were happening again!
Of course, such memories will always be incomplete, since nothing could
have capacity enough to record every detail of its own state.
(Otherwise, it would have to be larger than itself. ) Since we can't
remember everything, each individual mind faces the same problem that
scientists always face: they have no foolproof way to know, before the
fact, what are the most important things to notice and record.

Using the mind to examine itself is like science in another way. Just as
physicists cannot see the atoms they talk about, psychologists can't
watch the processes they try to examine. We only *know* such things
through their effects. But the problem is worse where the mind is
concerned, since scientists can read each other's notes, but different
parts of the mind can't read each other's memories.

We've now seen several reasons why we cannot simply watch our minds by
sitting still and waiting till our vision clears. The only course left
for us is to study the mind the way scientists do when something is too
large or small to see — by building theories based on evidence. Make a
guess; test it with a shrewd experiment; collect one's thoughts and
guess again. When introspection seems to work, it's not because we've
found a magic way to see inside ourselves. Instead, it means that we've
done some well-designed experiment.
