*15.3* memory
-------------

In order for a mind to think, it has to juggle fragments of its mental
states. Suppose you want to rearrange the furniture inside a room you
know. Your attention keeps shifting, first to one corner, then to
another, next to the center of the room, and then, perhaps, to how the
light falls on some object on a shelf. Different ideas and images
interrupt each other. At one moment it seems as though your entire mind
were focused on one small detail; at another moment you might dwell on
why you are thinking about that room in the first place; then you might
find yourself comparing or contrasting two different rearrangements of
that scene: *If that couch were over here, there would be room for
guests to chat — but no, that would block the path so that they wouldn't
be able to enter.*

How do our various agencies keep track of imaginary changes in scenes?
Where do the different versions go when out of mind, and how do we get
them back again? They must be stored as memories.

But what do we mean by that? Some readers may be surprised to learn that
biologists still have no well-established theory of what happens in our
brains when memories are formed. Psychologists, however, do agree that
there must be at least two different mechanisms. We appear to have
*long-term memories,* which can persist for days or years or all one's
life. We also have *short-term memories,* which last only for seconds or
minutes. In the next few sections we'll talk mostly about the uses of
these transient traces of our recent thoughts. For example, whenever we
get stuck in the course of solving a problem, we need to be able to
backtrack, modify our strategy, and try again. To do this we need those
short-term memories, if only not to repeat the same mistake.

How much do we remember? Sometimes we surprise ourselves by remembering
things we didn't know we knew. Could this mean that we remember
everything? Some older theories in psychology have supposed this to be
true, and there are many legends of persons having fabulous abilities.
For example, we often hear about people with *photographic memories*
that enable them to quickly memorize all the fine details of a
complicated picture or a page of text in a few seconds. So far as I can
tell, all of these tales are unfounded myths, and only professional
magicians or charlatans can produce such demonstrations.

In any case, I suspect we never really remember very much about a
particular experience. Instead, our various agencies selectively decide,
unconsciously, to transfer only certain states into their long-term
memories — perhaps because they have been classified as useful,
dangerous, unusual, or significant in other respects. It would be of
little use for us simply to maintain vast stores of unclassified
memories if, every time we needed one, we had to search through all of
them. Nor would it be of any use for them all to flood at once into our
agencies. Instead, each of us must develop fruitful and effective ways
to organize our memories — but how that's done is inaccessible to
consciousness. What barriers keep us from knowing such things? The next
few sections sketch out some theories, both about how our memory-systems
work and why we can't find this out directly by examining our own
thoughts.
