*28.6* minds and machines
-------------------------

Why does a mind seem so unlike any other kind of thing? First, as we
just said, minds aren't things — at least they share none of the usual
properties of things, like colors, sizes, shapes, or weights. Minds lie
beyond the reach of the senses of sound, touch, sight, smell, and taste.
Yet though minds aren't things at all, they certainly have vital links
to the things we call brains. What is the nature of those bonds? Are
minds peculiar entities, possessed alone by brains like ours? Or could
those qualities of minds be shared, to various degrees, by everything?
Now, when we said, *Minds are simply what brains do,* that should have
made us ask as well, *Does every other kind of process also have a
corresponding kind of mind?* This could lead to an argument. One side
might insist that this is merely a matter of degree, because people have
well-developed minds while bricks or stones have almost none. Another
side might try to draw a sharper boundary, arguing that only people can
have minds — and, maybe, certain animals. Which side is right? This
isn't a matter of wrong or right, since the issue is not about a fact,
but only about when it's wise to use a certain word. Those who wish to
reserve the label *mind* for only certain processes are obliged to
specify which processes deserve that name. Those who claim that every
kind of process has a corresponding type of mind are obliged to classify
all minds and processes. The trouble with this is that we don't yet have
adequate ways to classify processes.

Why are processes so hard to classify? In earlier times, we could
usually judge machines and processes by how they transformed raw
materials into finished products. But it makes no sense to speak of
brains as though they manufacture thoughts the way factories make cars.
The difference is that brains use processes that change themselves — and
this means we cannot separate such processes from the products they
produce. In particular, brains make memories, which change the ways
we'll subsequently think. The principal activities of brains are making
changes in themselves. Because the whole idea of self-modifying
processes is new to our experience, we cannot yet trust our commonsense
judgments about such matters.

As for brain science, no one ever before tried to study machines with
billions of working parts. That would be difficult enough, even if we
knew exactly how every part worked, and our present-day technology does
not yet allow us to study the brain cells of higher animals while
they're actually working and learning. This is partly because those
cells are extremely small and sensitive to injury, and partly because
they are so crowded together that we have not yet been able to map out
their interconnections.

These problems will all be solved once we have better instruments and
better theories. In the meantime, the hardest problems we have to face
do not come from philosophical questions about whether brains are
machines or not. There is not the slightest reason to doubt that brains
are anything other than machines with enormous numbers of parts that
work in perfect accord with physical laws. As far as anyone can tell,
our minds are merely complex processes. The serious problems come from
our having had so little experience with machines of such complexity
that we are not yet prepared to think effectively about them.
