*30.8* intelligence and resourcefulness
---------------------------------------

How could anything as complex as a human mind work so well for so many
years? We all appreciate those splendid feats of writing plays and
symphonies. But we rarely recognize how wonderful it is that a person
can traverse an entire lifetime without making a single really serious
mistake — like putting a fork in one's eye or using a window instead of
a door. How do we do such amazing feats as to imagine things we've never
seen before, to overcome obstacles, to repair things that are broken, to
speak to one another, to have new ideas? What magical trick makes us
intelligent? The trick is that there is no trick. The power of
intelligence stems from our vast diversity, not from any single, perfect
principle. Our species has evolved many effective although imperfect
methods, and each of us individually develops more on our own.
Eventually, very few of our actions and decisions come to depend on any
single mechanism. Instead, they emerge from conflicts and negotiations
among societies of processes that constantly challenge one another. In
this book we've seen many such dimensions of diversity:

The accumulation of myriad subagents. We learn many different ways to
achieve each kind of goal. The many realms of ordinary thought. When one
viewpoint fails to solve a problem, we can adopt other perspectives. The
endowment of several *instinctive* protominds. We embody different kinds
of organizations for achieving many kinds of goals. The hierarchies of
administration grown in accord with Papert's principle. When simple
methods fail, we can build new levels of organization. The evolutionary
vestiges of animals that still remain inside our brains. We use
machinery evolved from fish, amphibia, reptiles, and earlier mammals.
The sequence of stages of the growing child's personality. We accumulate
different personalities that we can apply to

different situations. The complex, ever-growing heritage of language and
culture. We can use methods and ideas developed by millions of our
ancestors. The subordination of thought processes to censors and
suppressors. We do not need perfect methods, since we can remember how
imperfect methods fail.

Each of these dimensions gives you toughness and versatility. They offer
alternative ways to proceed when any system fails. If part of your
society of mind proposes to do what other parts find unacceptable, your
agencies can usually find another way. Sometimes you merely need to turn
to another branch of the same accumulation. When that fails, you can
ascend to a higher level and engage a larger change in strategy. Then,
even if an entire agency should fail, your brain retains earlier
versions of it. This means that every facet of your personality may have
the option to *regress* to an earlier stage, which already has proved
itself competent to deal with the usual problems of life. Finally, when
even that won't work, you can usually switch to an entirely different
family of agencies. Whenever anything goes wrong, there are always other
realms of thought.
