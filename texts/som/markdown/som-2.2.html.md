*2.2* Novelists and reductionists
---------------------------------

It's always best when mysteries can be explained in terms of things we
know. But when we find this hard to do, we must decide whether to keep
trying to make old theories work or to discard them and try new ones. I
think this is partly a matter of personality. Let's call *Reductionists*
those people who prefer to build on old ideas, and *Novelists* the ones
who like to champion new hypotheses. Reduction- ists are usually right —
at least at science's cautious core, where novelties rarely survive for
long. Outside that realm, though, novelists reign, since older ideas
have had more time to show their flaws.

It really is amazing how certain sciences depend upon so few kinds of
explanations. The science of physics can now explain virtually
everything we see, at least in principle, in terms of how a very few
kinds of particles and force-fields interact. Over the past few
centuries reductionism has been remarkably successful. What makes it
possible to describe so much of the world in terms of so few basic
rules? No one knows.

Many scientists look on chemistry and physics as ideal models of what
psychology should be like. After all, the atoms in the brain are subject
to the same all-inclusive physical laws that govern every other form of
matter. Then can we also explain what our brains actually do entirely in
terms of those same basic principles? The answer is no, simply because
even if we understood how each of our billions of brain cells works
separately, this would not tell us how the brain works as an agency. The
*laws of thought* depend not only upon the properties of those brain
cells, but also on how they are connected. And these connections are
established not by the basic, general laws of physics, but by the
particular arrangements of the millions of bits of information in our
inherited genes. To be sure, general laws apply to everything. But, for
that very reason, they can rarely explain anything in particular.

Does this mean that psychology must reject the laws of physics and find
its own? Of course not. It is not a matter of different laws, but of
additional kinds of theories and principles that operate at higher
levels of organization. Our ideas of how Builder works as an agency need
not, and must not, conflict with our knowledge of how Builder's
lower-level agents work. Each higher level of description must add to
our knowledge about lower levels, rather than replace it. We'll return
to the idea of *level* at many places in this book.

Will psychology ever resemble any of the sciences that have successfully
reduced their subjects to only a very few principles? That depends on
what you mean by *few.* In physics, we're used to explanations in terms
of perhaps a dozen basic principles. For psychology, our explanations
will have to combine hundreds of smaller theories. To physicists, that
number may seem too large. To humanists, it may seem too small.
