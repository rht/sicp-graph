*24.1* the speed of thought
---------------------------

When we enter a room, we seem to see the entire scene at a glance. But,
really, it takes time to see — to apprehend all the details and see if
they confirm our expectations and beliefs. Our first impressions often
have to be revised. Still, one wonders how so many kinds of visual cues
can lead so quickly to consistent views. What could explain the blinding
speed of sight?

The secret is that sight is intertwined with memory. When face to face
with someone you've just met, you seem to react almost instantly — but
not as much to what you see as to what that sight *reminds* you of. The
moment you sense the presence of a person, a whole world of assumptions
is aroused that are usually true about people in general. At the same
time, certain superficial cues remind you of particular people you've
already met. Unconsciously, then, you will assume that this stranger
must also resemble them, not only in appearance but in other traits as
well. No amount of self-discipline can keep those superficial
similarities from provoking assumptions that may then affect your
judgments and decisions. When we disapprove of this, we complain about
stereotypes — and when we sympathize with it, we speak of sensitivity
and empathy.

It's much the same with language, too. If someone said, *It's raining
frogs,* your mind would swiftly fill with thoughts about the origins of
those frogs, about what happens to them when they hit the ground, about
what could have caused that peculiar plague, and about whether or not
the announcer had gone mad. Yet the stimulus for all of this is just
three words. How do our minds conceive such complex scenes from such
sparse cues? The additional details must come from memories and
reasoning.

Most older theories in psychology could not account for how a mind could
do such things — because, I think, those theories were based on ideas
about *chunks* of memory that were either much too small or much too
large. Some of those theories tried to explain appearances only in terms
of low-level *cues,* while other theories tried to deal with entire
scenes at once. None of those theories ever got very far. The next few
sections describe what seems to be a useful compromise; at least it has
led to some better results in some projects concerned with Artificial
Intelligence. Our idea is that each perceptual experience activates some
structures that we'll call frames — structures we've acquired in the
course of previous experience. We all remember millions of frames, each
representing some stereotyped situation like meeting a certain kind of
person, being in a certain kind of room, or attending a certain kind of
party.
