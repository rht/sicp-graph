*6.13* self-knowledge is dangerous
----------------------------------

To “know oneself&rdquo more perfectly might seem to promise something
powerful and good. But there are fallacies concealed behind that happy
thought. No doubt, a mind that wants to change itself could benefit from
knowing how it works. But such knowledge might as easily encourage us to
wreck ourselves — if we had ways to poke our clumsy mental fingers into
the tricky circuits of the mind's machinery. Could this be why our
brains force us to play those games of mental hide and seek?

Just see how prone we are to risk experiments that change ourselves; how
fatally we're drawn to drugs, to meditation, music, even conversation —
all powerful addictions that can change our very personalities. Just see
how everyone is entranced by any promise to transgress the bounds of
normal pleasure and reward.

In ordinary life, our pleasure systems help us learn — and, therefore,
to behave ourselves — by forcing checks and balances on us. Why, for
example, do we become bored when doing the same thing over and over,
even if that activity was pleasant at first? This appears to be one
property of our pleasure systems; without enough variety, they tend to
satiate. Every learning machine must have some such protective scheme,
since otherwise it could get trapped into endlessly repeating the same
activity. We are fortunate to be equipped with mechanisms that keep us
from wasting too much time, and it is fortunate, too, that we find it
hard to suppress such mechanisms.

If we could deliberately seize control of our pleasure systems, we could
reproduce the pleasure of success without the need for any actual
accomplishment. And that would be the end of everything.

What prevents such meddling? Our minds are bound by many
self-constraints. For example, we find it hard to determine what's
happening inside the mind. Later, when we talk about infant development,
we'll see that even if our inner eyes could see what's there, we'd find
it singularly hard to change the agents we might want most to change —
the ones that, in our infancy, helped shape our longest-lasting
self-ideals.

These agents are hard to change because of their special evolutionary
origin. The long-term stability of many other mental agencies depends on
how slowly we change our images of what we ought to be like. Few of us
would survive if, left to random chance, our most adventurous impulses
could tamper freely with the basis of our personalities. Why would that
be such a bad thing to do? Because an ordinary *change of mind* can be
reversed if it leads to a bad result. But when you change your
self-ideals — then nothing is left to turn you back.

Sigmund Freud theorized that each person's growth is governed by
unconscious needs to please, placate, oppose, or terminate our images of
parental authority. If we recognized the influence of those old images,
however, we might consider them too infantile or too unworthy to
tolerate and seek to replace them with something better. But then what
would we substitute for them — once we divested ourselves of all those
ties to instinct and society? We'd each end up as instruments of even
more capricious sorts of self-invented goals.

It's mainly when our systems fail that consciousness becomes engaged.
For example, we walk and talk without much sense of how we actually do
those things. But a person with an injured leg may, for the first time,
begin to formulate theories about how walking works (*To turn to the
left, I'll have to push myself that way,*) and then perhaps consider
which muscles might accomplish that goal. When we recognize that we're
confused, we begin to reflect on how our minds solve problems and engage
the little we know about our strategies of thought. Then we find
ourselves saying things like this:

*Now I must get organized. Why can't I concentrate on the important
questions and not get distracted by those other nonessential details?*

Paradoxically, it is smart to realize that one is confused — as opposed
to being confused without knowing it. For that stimulates us to apply
our intellect to altering or repairing the defective process. Yet we
dislike and disparage the sense of confusion, not appreciating the
quality of this recognition.

However, once your B-brains make you start to ask yourself *What was I
really attempting to do?* you can exploit that as an opportunity to
change your goals or change how you describe your situation. That way,
you can escape the distress of feeling trapped because there seem to be
no adequate alternatives. The conscious experience of confusion can
resemble pain; perhaps this is because of how they both impel us to
discover ways to escape from a predicament. The difference is that
confusion is directed against a person's own failing state of mind,
whereas pain reflects exterior disturbances. In either case, internal
processes must be demolished and rebuilt.

Both confusion and pain have injurious effects when they lead us to
abandon goals on larger scales than appropriate: *The entire subject
makes me feel ill. Perhaps I should abandon the whole project,
occupation, or relationship.* But even such dispiriting thoughts can
serve as probes for finding other agencies that might be engaged for
help.
