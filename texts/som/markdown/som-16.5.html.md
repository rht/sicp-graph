*16.5* avalanche effects
------------------------

Few of the schemes we've discussed would actually work if they were
built exactly as they were described. Most of them would soon break down
because virtually all their agents would become engaged into
unconstrained activity. Suppose each typical agent tends to arouse
several others. Then each of those would turn on several more — and each
of those would turn on yet others; the activity would spread faster than
a forest fire. But all that activity would accomplish nothing, since all
those agents would interfere with each other and none of them could gain
control of the resources they need. Indeed, this is more or less what
happens in an attack of epilepsy.

Similar problems arise in every biological system. Each simple principle
or mechanism must be controlled to operate within some limited range.
Even little groups of genes embody schemes to regulate the quantities of
proteins they cause to be manufactured inside every cell. We find the
same pattern repeated on every scale. Every biological tissue, organ,
and system is regulated by several kinds of control mechanisms, and
wherever these fail we find disease. What normally protects our brains
from such avalanches of activity? The cross- exclusion scheme is
probably the most usual way to regulate the levels of activities within
our agencies. But there are also several other frequently encountered
schemes to prevent explosions.

Conservation: Force all activities to depend upon some substance or
other kind of quantity of which only a certain amount is available. For
example, we controlled our Snarc machine by setting a limit on the total
electric current available to all the agents; this permitted only a few
of them to be active at any particular moment. Negative Feedback: Supply
a *summary* device that estimates the total activity in the agency and
then broadcasts to that agency an *inhibitory* signal whose strength is
in proportion to that total. This will tend to damp down incipient
avalanches.

Censors and Suppressors: The *conservation* and *feedback* schemes tend
to be indiscriminate. Later we'll discuss methods that are more
sensitive and versatile in learning to recognize — and then to avoid —
specific patterns of activity that have led to trouble in the past.

These methods are simple enough to be applied inside small societies,
but they are not versatile enough to solve all the management
difficulties that can arise in the more complex societies we need for
learning to solve harder problems. Fortunately, systems built upon
larger scales may be able to apply their own enhanced abilities to
managing themselves — by formulating and solving their own
self-regulation problems. In the next few sections we'll see how such
capacities could grow in the course of several stages of development.
Not all of this need happen independently inside each separate child's
mind, because that child's family and cultural community can develop
self-regulation schemes of great complexity. All human communities seem
to work out policies for how their members ought to think, in forms that
are thought of as common sense or as law, religion, or philosophy.
