*5.6* traits
------------

Isn't it remarkable that words can portray human individuals? You might
suppose this should be impossible, considering how much there is to say.
Then what permits a writer to depict such seemingly real personalities?
It is because we all agree on so many things that are left unsaid. For
example, we assume that all the characters are possessed of what we call
*commonsense knowledge,* and we also agree on many generalities about
what we call *human nature.*

Hostility evokes defensiveness. Frustration arouses aggression.

We also recognize that individuals have particular qualities and traits
of character.

Jane is tidy. Mary's timid. Grace is smart. That's not the sort of thing
Charles does. It's not his style.

Why should traits like these exist? Humanists are prone to boast about
how hard it is to grasp the measure of a mind. But let's ask instead,
*What makes personalities so easy to portray?* Why, for example, should
any person tend toward a general quality of being neat, rather than
simply being tidy about some things and messy about others? Why should
our personalities show such coherencies? How could it be that a system
assembled from a million agencies can be described by short and simple
strings of words? Here are some possible reasons.

Selectivity: First we should face the fact that our images of other
minds are often falsely clear. We tend to think of another person's
*personality* in terms of that which we can describe — and tend to set
aside the rest as though it simply weren't there. Style: To escape the
effort of making decisions we consider unimportant, we tend to develop
policies that become so systematic that they can be discerned from the
outside and characterized as personal traits.

Predictability: Because it is hard to maintain friendship without trust,
we try to conform to the expectations of our friends. Then, to the
extent that we frame our images of our associates in terms of traits, we
find ourselves teaching ourselves to behave in accord with those same
descriptions. Self-Reliance: Thus, over time, imagined traits can make
themselves actual! For even to carry out our own plans, we must be able
to predict what we ourselves are likely to do — and that will become
easier the more we simplify ourselves.

It's nice to be able to trust our friends, but we need to be able to
trust ourselves. How can that be possible when we can't be sure what's
in our own heads? One way to accomplish this is by thinking of ourselves
in terms of traits — and then proceeding to train ourselves to behave
according to those self-images. Still, a personality is merely the
surface of a person. What we call traits are only the regularities we
manage to perceive. We never really know ourselves because there are so
many other processes and policies that never show themselves directly in
our behavior but work behind the scenes.
