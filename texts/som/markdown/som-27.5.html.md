*27.5* jokes
------------

Why do jokes have such peculiar psychological effects? In 1905, Sigmund
Freud published a book explaining that we form censors in our minds as
barriers against forbidden thoughts. Most jokes, he said, are stories
designed to fool the censors. A joke's power comes from a description
that fits two different frames at once. The first meaning must be
transparent and innocent, while the second meaning is disguised and
reprehensible. The censors recognize only the innocent meaning because
they are too simple-minded to penetrate the forbidden meaning's
disguise. Then, once that first interpretation is firmly planted in the
mind, a final turn of word or phrase suddenly replaces it with the other
one. The censored thought has been slipped through; a prohibited wish
has been enjoyed.

Freud suggested that children construct censors in response to
prohibitions by their parents or peers. This explains why so many jokes
involve taboos concerning cruelty, sexuality, and other subjects that
human communities typically link to guilt, disgust, or shame. But it
troubled Freud that this theory did not account for the *nonsense jokes*
people seem to enjoy so much. The trouble was that these seemed
unrelated to social prohibitions. He could not explain why people find
humor in the idea of *a knife that has lost both its blade and its
handle.*

Freud considered several explanations to account for pointless nonsense
jokes but concluded that none of those theories was good enough. One
theory was that people tell nonsense jokes for the pleasure of arousing
the expectation of a real joke and then frustrating the listener.
Another theory was that senselessness reflects *a wish to return to
carefree childhood, when one was permitted to think without any
compulsion to be logical, and to put words together without sense, for
the simpler pleasures of rhythm or rhyme.* Freud put it this way:

Little by little the child is forbidden this enjoyment, till there
remain only significant combinations of words. But attempts still emerge
to disregard restrictions which were learned.

In yet a third theory, Freud conjectured that humor is a way to ward off
suffering — as when, in desperate situations, we make jokes as though
the world were nothing but a game. Freud suggested that this is when the
superego tries to comfort the childlike ego by rejecting all reality;
but he was uneasy about this idea because such kindliness conflicted
with his image of the superego's usual stern, strict character.

Despite Freud's complicated doubts, I'll argue that he was right all
along. Once we recognize that ordinary thinking, too, requires censors
to suppress ineffectual mental processes, then all the different-seeming
forms of jokes will seem more similar. Absurd results of reasoning must
be tabooed as thoroughly as social mistakes and inanities! And that's
why stupid thoughts can seem as humorous as antisocial ones.
