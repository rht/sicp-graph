Language builds things in our minds. Yet words themselves can't be the
substance of our thoughts. They have no meanings by themselves; they're
only special sorts of marks or sounds. If we're to understand how
language works, we must discard the usual view that words denote or
represent, or designate; instead, their function is control: each word
makes various agents change what various other agents do. If we want to
understand how language works, we must never forget that our
thinking-in-words reveals only a fragment of the mind's activity.

We often seem to think in words. Yet we do this with no conscious sense
of where and why those words originate or how they then proceed to
influence our further thoughts and what we subsequently do. Our inner
monologues and dialogues proceed without any effort, deliberation, or
sense of how they're done. Now you might argue that you do know what
brings those words to mind — in the sense that they are how you
*express* your intentions and ideas. But that amounts to the same thing
— since your intentions, too, appear to come and go in ways you do not
understand. Suppose, for example, that at a certain moment you find you
want to leave the room. Then, naturally, you'd look for the door. And
this involves two mysteries:

What made you want to leave the room? Was it simply that you became
tired of staying in that room? Was it because you remembered something
else you had to do? Whatever reasons come to mind, you still must ask
what led to them. The further back you trace your thoughts, the vaguer
seem those causal chains.

The other side of the mystery is that we are equally ignorant of

how we respond to our own intentions. Given a desire to leave the room,
what led you to the thought of *door*? You only know that first you
thought, *It's time to go,* and then you thought, *Where is the door?*

We're all so used to this that we regard it as completely natural. Yet
we have barely any sense of why each thought follows the last. What
connects the idea of leaving with the idea of door? Does this result
from some direct connection between two partial states of mind, of
leaving and of door? Does it involve some sort of less direct
connection, not between those states themselves, but only between some
signals that somehow represent those states? Or is it the product of yet
more complex mechanisms?

Our introspective abilities are too weak to answer such questions. The
words we think seem to hover in some insubstantial interface wherein we
understand neither the origins of the symbol-signs that seem to express
our desires nor the destinations wherein they lead to actions and
accomplishments. This is why words and images seem so magical: they work
without our knowing how or why. At one moment a word can seem enormously
meaningful; at the next moment it can seem no more than a sequence of
sounds. And this is as it should be. It is the underlying emptiness of
words that gives them their potential versatility. The less there is in
a treasure chest, the more you'll be able to put in it.
