*14.5* the investment principle

Some ideas acquire undue influence. The prominence of the body-support
idea is well-deserved; no other scheme compares to its ability to help
us link things into causelike chains. But there are other, not so
honorable ways for ideas to gather influence.

The Investment Principle: Our oldest ideas have unfair advantages over
those that come later. The earlier we learn a skill, the more methods we
can acquire for using it. Each new idea must then compete against the
larger mass of skills the old ideas have accumulated.

This is why it's so much easier to do new things in older ways. Each new
idea, however good in principle, seems awkward until we master it. So
old ideas keep gaining strength, while new ones can rarely catch up.
Furthermore, our oldest and best-developed skills will be the first to
spread to other realms of thought where again they'll start out far
enough ahead to keep any new ideas from taking root.

In the short run, you will usually do better by using an old idea than
by starting out anew. If you can already play the piano well, it is easy
to start playing the organ in the same way. The many superficial
similarities will make it hard for you to tell which aspects of your old
skills are unsuitable, and the easiest course is to keep applying your
old technique, trying to patch each flaw until none show. In the long
run, you'd probably do better by starting fresh with a new technique —
and then borrowing what you can from your older skills. The trouble is
that we're almost always immersed in the *short run.* So the principles
both of investment and of exception make us reluctant to tamper with our
well-established skills and uniframes lest we endanger all that we have
built upon those old foundations. I don't mean to say there's anything
wrong, in principle, with using what you are comfortable with and
already know. But it is dangerous to support your old ideas merely by
accumulating ways to sidestep their deficiencies. That only increases
the power of your old ideas to overcome new ones and could lead your
style of thought to base itself yet all the more, as time goes by, upon
less and less.

Evolution illustrates how processes can become enslaved by the
investment principle. Why do so many animals contain their brains inside
their heads — as with fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and bats? This
arrangement was inherited long before our earliest aquatic ancestor
first crawled upon the land three hundred million years ago. For many of
those animals — woodpeckers, for example — another arrangement might
serve at least as well. But once the pattern of centralizing so many
functions in the head was established, it carried with it great networks
of dependencies involving many aspects of anatomy. Because of this, any
mutation that changed any part of that arrangement would disrupt many
other parts and lead to dreadful handicaps, at least in the short run of
evolution. And because evolution is so inherently short-sighted, it
would not help if, over longer spans of time, such changes could lead to
advantages. Perhaps the best example of this can be seen in the fact
that virtually every detail of every plant and animal on earth is
written in terms of a genetic code that has scarcely changed a single
bit in a billion years. It does not seem to be a particularly efficient
or reliable code, yet so many structures have been based on it that all
living things are stuck with it! To change a single detail of that code
would cause so many proteins to get tangled up that not a single cell
could live.
