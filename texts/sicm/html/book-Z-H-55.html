<h2><a href="book-Z-H-4.html#%_toc_%_sec_4.7">4.7&nbsp;&nbsp;Summary</a></h2>
<p>Surfaces of section of a typical Hamiltonian system exhibit a
menagerie of features including fixed points, invariant curves,
resonance islands, and chaotic zones.  Integrable systems have much
simpler surfaces of section.  By adding small effects to integrable
systems we get insight into how this complicated behavior emerges.</p>
<p>
Surfaces of section for integrable systems display only certain
characteristic orbit types.  There are fixed points, which correspond
to equilibria or periodic orbits.  A fixed point may be stable or
unstable, depending on the stability of the corresponding equilibrium
or orbit.  There are sets
of points on the section that are asymptotic forward and backward in
time to the unstable fixed point.  And there are sets of trajectories
that fall on invariant curves.  If the rotation number of the invariant
curve is irrational, each of these trajectories densely covers the
invariant curve; if the rotation number is rational, then each
trajectory visits only a finite number of points on the invariant
curve.</p>
<p>
Linear stability analysis addresses the nature of the motion near the
fixed points on the section.  These points correspond to either
equilibrium points or periodic orbits.  There are characteristic
frequencies of the motion, each with an associated characteristic
direction.  For Hamiltonian systems only certain patterns of
characteristic frequencies are possible.  On two-dimensional 
area-preserving surfaces of section, as generated by Hamiltonian systems,
fixed points are linearly stable (elliptic fixed points) or linearly
unstable (hyperbolic fixed points).</p>
<p>
With the addition of small effects, the surface of section changes in
certain typical ways.  One characteristic change occurs near the
unstable fixed points.  The stable and unstable manifolds, those curves
consisting of the sets of points that are asymptotic to the unstable
fixed points forward and backward in time, no longer join smoothly,
but instead cross.  A first crossing implies that there are an infinite
number of other crossings, and the stable and unstable manifolds
develop an extremely complicated tangle.</p>
<p>
The Poincar&eacute;-Birkhoff construction shows how the infinite number of
periodic orbits on an invariant curve with rational rotation number
that is characteristic of an integrable system degenerates into a
finite number of alternating stable and unstable fixed points when the
system becomes nonintegrable.  This phenomenon is recursive, so we
find that it develops an infinite hierarchy of structure: The region
around every stable fixed point is itself filled with
commensurabilities with alternating stable and unstable fixed points.</p>
<p>
Some invariant curves survive the addition of small effects to an
integrable system.  The Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser theorem proves that
some invariant curves persist upon perturbation.  We can find
invariant curves of particular rotation numbers by comparing the
pattern of points generated for a candidate initial point on the
invariant curve to the expected pattern of points for the invariant
curve being sought.  As the additional effect is made stronger, the
invariant curves that survive longest are those with the most
irrational rotation number.  At the point of breakup, the probability
of visitation of various points on the invariant curve develops a
self-similar appearance.  For larger perturbations, the invariant
curve disappears, leaving an invariant set with an infinite number of
holes.</p>
