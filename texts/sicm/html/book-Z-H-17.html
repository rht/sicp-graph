An advantage of the Lagrangian approach is that coordinates can
often be chosen that exactly describe the freedom of the system,
automatically incorporating any constraints.  We may also use
coordinates that have more freedom than the system
actually has and consider explicit constraints among the 
coordinates.  For example, the planar pendulum has a one-dimensional
configuration space.  We have formulated this problem using the angle
from the vertical as the configuration coordinate.  Alternatively, we
may choose to represent the pendulum as a body moving in the plane,
constrained to be on the circle of the correct radius around the
pivot.  We would like to have valid descriptions for both choices and
show they are equivalent.  In this section we develop tools to handle
problems with explicit constraints.  The constraints considered here
are more general than those used in the demonstration that the
Lagrangian for systems with rigid constraints can be written as the
difference of kinetic and potential energies (see
section&nbsp;<a href="book-Z-H-13.html#%_sec_1.6.2">1.6.2</a>).</p>
<p>
Suppose the configuration of a system with <em>n</em> degrees of freedom
is specified by <em>n</em> + 1 coordinates and that configuration paths <em>q</em> are
constrained to satisfy some relation of the form
<a name="EQUATION_1.175"></a></p>
<div align=left><img src="chap1-Z-G-223.gif" border="0"></div>
<p>
How do we formulate the equations of motion?  One approach would be to
use the constraint equation to eliminate one of the 
coordinates in favor of the rest; then the evolution of the
reduced set of generalized coordinates would be described by the usual
Lagrange equations.  The equations governing the evolution of
coordinates that are not fully independent should be
equivalent.  </p>
<p>
We can address the problem of formulating equations of motion for
systems with redundant coordinates by returning to the action
principle.  Realizable paths are distinguished from other paths by
having stationary action.  Stationary refers to the fact that the
action does not change with certain small variations of the path.
What variations should be considered?  We have seen that
velocity-independent rigid constraints can be used to eliminate
redundant coordinates.  In the irredundant coordinates we distinguished
realizable paths by using variations that by construction satisfy the
constraints.  Thus in the case where constraints can be used to
eliminate redundant coordinates we can restrict the variations in the
path to those that are consistent with the constraints.</p>
<p>
So how does the restriction of the possible variations affect the
argument that led to Lagrange's equations (refer to
section&nbsp;<a href="book-Z-H-12.html#%_sec_1.5">1.5</a>)?  Actually most of the
calculation is unaffected.  The condition that the action is
stationary still reduces to the 
condition&nbsp;(<a href="book-Z-H-12.html#EQUATION_1.34">1.34</a>):
<a name="EQUATION_1.176"></a></p>
<div align=left><img src="chap1-Z-G-224.gif" border="0"></div>
<p>
At this point we argued that because the variations <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-13.gif" border="0"> are
arbitrary (except for conditions at the endpoints), the only way for
the integral to be zero is for the integrand to be zero.  Furthermore,
the freedom in our choice of <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-13.gif" border="0"> allowed us to deduce that the factor 
multiplying <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-13.gif" border="0"> in the integrand must be identically zero, thereby
deriving Lagrange's equations.</p>
<p>
Now the choice of <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-13.gif" border="0"> is not completely free.  We can still deduce
from the arbitrariness of <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-13.gif" border="0"> that the integrand must be zero,<a name="call_footnote_Temp_155" href="#footnote_Temp_155"><sup><small>88</small></sup></a>
but we can no longer deduce that the factor
multiplying <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-13.gif" border="0"> is zero (only that the projection of this factor
onto acceptable variations is zero).  So we have
<a name="EQUATION_1.177"></a></p>
<div align=left><img src="chap1-Z-G-225.gif" border="0"></div>
<p>
with <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-13.gif" border="0"> subject to the constraints.</p>
<p>
A path <em>q</em> satisfies the constraint if <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-54.gif" border="0">[<em>q</em>]
 =  <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-16.gif" border="0"> <small>o</small> <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-9.gif" border="0">[<em>q</em>]  =  0.  The constraint must be satisfied even
for the varied path, so we allow only variations <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-13.gif" border="0"> for which the
variation of the constraint is zero:
<a name="EQUATION_1.178"></a></p>
<div align=left><img src="chap1-Z-G-226.gif" border="0"></div>
<p>
We can say that the variation must be ``tangent'' to the constraint
surface.
Expanding this with the chain rule, a variation <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-13.gif" border="0"> is tangent to the
constraint surface <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-16.gif" border="0"> if 
<a name="EQUATION_1.179"></a></p>
<div align=left><img src="chap1-Z-G-227.gif" border="0"></div>
<p>
Note that these are functions of time; the variation at a given time
is tangent to the constraint at that time.</p>
<p>

<p><a name="%_idx_986"></a><a name="%_idx_988"></a><a name="%_idx_990"></a>
Consider constraints that do not depend on velocities: 
</p>
<div align=left><img src="chap1-Z-G-228.gif" border="0"></div>
<p> 
In this case the variation is tangent to the
constraint surface if
<a name="EQUATION_1.180"></a></p>
<div align=left><img src="chap1-Z-G-229.gif" border="0"></div>
<p>
Together, equations&nbsp;(<a href="#EQUATION_1.177">1.177</a>) and
(<a href="#EQUATION_1.180">1.180</a>) should determine the motion, but how do
we eliminate <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-13.gif" border="0">?  The residual of the Lagrange
equations is orthogonal<a name="call_footnote_Temp_156" href="#footnote_Temp_156"><sup><small>89</small></sup></a>
to any <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-13.gif" border="0"> that is orthogonal to the
normal to the constraint surface.  A vector that is orthogonal to
all vectors orthogonal to a given vector is parallel to the given
vector.  Thus, the residual of Lagrange's equations is parallel to the
normal to the constraint surface; the two must be proportional:
<a name="EQUATION_1.181"></a></p>
<div align=left><img src="chap1-Z-G-230.gif" border="0"></div>
<p>
That the two vectors are parallel everywhere along the path does not
guarantee that the proportionality factor is the same at each moment
along the path, so the proportionality factor <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-40.gif" border="0"> is some
function of time, which may depend on the path under consideration.
These equations, with the constraint equation <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-16.gif" border="0"> <small>o</small> <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-9.gif" border="0">[<em>q</em>]
 =  0, are the governing equations.  These equations are sufficient to
determine the path <em>q</em> and to eliminate the unknown function
<img src="chap1-Z-G-D-40.gif" border="0">.</p>

<h4><a href="book-Z-H-4.html#%_toc_%_sec_Temp_157">Now watch this</a></h4>
<p><a name="%_idx_1000"></a><a name="%_idx_1002"></a>Suppose we form an augmented Lagrangian treating
<img src="chap1-Z-G-D-40.gif" border="0"> as one of the coordinates:
<a name="EQUATION_1.182"></a></p>
<div align=left><img src="chap1-Z-G-231.gif" border="0"></div>
<p>
The Lagrange equations associated with the coordinates <em>q</em> are just
the modified Lagrange
equations&nbsp;(<a href="#EQUATION_1.181">1.181</a>),
and the Lagrange equation associated with <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-40.gif" border="0"> is just the
constraint equation.  (Note that <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-41.gif" border="0"> does not appear in
the augmented Lagrangian.)  So the Lagrange equations for this augmented
Lagrangian fully encapsulate the modification to the Lagrange
equations that is imposed by the addition of an explicit coordinate
constraint, at the expense of introducing extra degrees of freedom.  
Notice that this Lagrangian is of the same form as
the Lagrangian (equation&nbsp;<a href="book-Z-H-13.html#EQUATION_1.89">1.89</a>) that we used in the
derivation of <em>L</em> = <em>T</em> <tt>-</tt> <em>V</em> for rigid systems
(section&nbsp;<a href="book-Z-H-13.html#%_sec_1.6.2">1.6.2</a>).</p>
<p>

</p>
<a name="%_sec_Temp_158"></a>
<h4><a href="book-Z-H-4.html#%_toc_%_sec_Temp_158">Alternatively</a></h4>
<p>How do we know that we have enough information to eliminate the
unknown function <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-40.gif" border="0"> from
equations&nbsp;(<a href="#EQUATION_1.181">1.181</a>), or
that the extra degree of freedom introduced in
Lagrangian&nbsp;(<a href="#EQUATION_1.182">1.182</a>) is purely formal?</p>
<p>
If <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-40.gif" border="0"> could be written as a function of the solution
state path, then it would be clear that it is determined by the state
and can thus be eliminated.  Suppose <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-40.gif" border="0"> can be written as a
composition of a state-dependent function with the path: <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-40.gif" border="0">
 =  <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-55.gif" border="0"> <small>o</small> <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-9.gif" border="0">[<em>q</em>].  Consider the Lagrangian
<a name="EQUATION_1.183"></a></p>
<div align=left><img src="chap1-Z-G-232.gif" border="0"></div>
<p>
This new Lagrangian has no extra degrees of freedom.
The Lagrange equations for <em>L</em>'' are the Lagrange equations for <em>L</em>
with additional terms arising from the product of <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-55.gif" border="0"> <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-16.gif" border="0">.
Applying the Euler-Lagrange operator  <em>E</em> (see
section&nbsp;<a href="book-Z-H-16.html#%_sec_1.9">1.9</a>) to this Lagrangian gives<a name="call_footnote_Temp_159" href="#footnote_Temp_159"><sup><small>90</small></sup></a>
<a name="EQUATION_1.184"></a></p>
<div align=left><img src="chap1-Z-G-234.gif" border="0"></div>
<p>
Composition of  <em>E</em>[<em>L</em>''] with <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-9.gif" border="0">[<em>q</em>] gives the Lagrange
equations for the path <em>q</em>.  Using the fact that
the constraint is satisfied on the path
<img src="chap1-Z-G-D-16.gif" border="0"> <small>o</small> <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-9.gif" border="0">[<em>q</em>]  =  0 and consequently
 <em>D</em><sub><em>t</em></sub> <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-16.gif" border="0"> <small>o</small> <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-9.gif" border="0">[<em>q</em>]  =  0,
we have
<a name="EQUATION_1.185"></a></p>
<div align=left><img src="chap1-Z-G-235.gif" border="0"></div>
<p>
where we have used <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-40.gif" border="0">  =  <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-55.gif" border="0"> <small>o</small> <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-9.gif" border="0">[<em>q</em>].
If we now use the fact that we are dealing only with coordinate
constraints, <img src="front-Z-G-D-2.gif" border="0"><sub>2</sub> <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-16.gif" border="0">  =  0, then
<a name="EQUATION_1.186"></a></p>
<div align=left><img src="chap1-Z-G-236.gif" border="0"></div>
<p>
The Lagrange equations are the same as those derived from
the augmented Lagrangian <em>L</em>'.  The difference is that now we see that
<img src="chap1-Z-G-D-40.gif" border="0">  =  <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-55.gif" border="0"> <small>o</small> <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-9.gif" border="0">[<em>q</em>] is determined by the unaugmented state.
This is the same as saying that <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-40.gif" border="0"> can be eliminated.</p>
<p>
Considering only the formal validity of the Lagrange equations for the
augmented Lagrangian, we could not deduce that <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-40.gif" border="0"> could
be written as the composition of a state-dependent function <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-55.gif" border="0">
with <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-9.gif" border="0">[<em>q</em>].  The explicit Lagrange equations derived from the
augmented Lagrangian depend on the accelerations <em>D</em><sup>2</sup><em>q</em> as well as
<img src="chap1-Z-G-D-40.gif" border="0">, so we cannot deduce separately that either is the
composition of a state-dependent function and <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-9.gif" border="0">[<em>q</em>].  However, now
we see that <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-40.gif" border="0"> is such a composition.  This allows us to
deduce that <em>D</em><sup>2</sup><em>q</em> is also a state-dependent function composed
with the path.  The evolution of the system is determined from the
dynamical state.</p>

<h4><a href="book-Z-H-4.html#%_toc_%_sec_Temp_160">The pendulum using constraints</a></h4>
<p><a name="%_idx_1004"></a>The pendulum can be formulated as the motion of a massive particle in
a vertical plane subject to the constraint that the distance to the
pivot is constant (see figure&nbsp;<a href="#FIGURE_1.8">1.8</a>).</p>
<p>
In this formulation, the kinetic and potential energies in the
Lagrangian are those of an unconstrained particle in a uniform
gravitational acceleration.  A Lagrangian for the unconstrained
particle is
<a name="EQUATION_1.187"></a></p>
<div align=left><img src="chap1-Z-G-238.gif" border="0"></div>
<p>
The constraint that the pendulum moves in a circle of radius <em>l</em> about
the pivot is<a name="call_footnote_Temp_161" href="#footnote_Temp_161"><sup><small>91</small></sup></a>
<a name="EQUATION_1.188"></a></p>
<div align=left><img src="chap1-Z-G-239.gif" border="0"></div>
<p>
The augmented Lagrangian is
<a name="EQUATION_1.189"></a></p>
<div align=left><img src="chap1-Z-G-240.gif" border="0"></div>
<p>
The Lagrange equations for the augmented Lagrangian are
<a name="EQUATION_1.190"></a></p>
<div align=left><img src="chap1-Z-G-241.gif" border="0"></div>
<p>
These equations are sufficient to solve for the motion of
the pendulum.  </p>
<p>
It should not be surprising that these equations simplify if we switch
to ``polar'' coordinates
<a name="EQUATION_1.193"></a></p>
<div align=left><img src="chap1-Z-G-242.gif" border="0"></div>
<p>
Substituting this into the constraint equation, we determine that <em>r</em>  = 
<em>l</em>, a constant.  Forming the derivatives and substituting into the
other two equations, we find
<a name="EQUATION_1.194"></a></p>
<div align=left><img src="chap1-Z-G-243.gif" border="0"></div>
<p>
Multiplying the first by cos <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-19.gif" border="0"> and the second by sin <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-19.gif" border="0">
and adding, we find
<a name="EQUATION_1.196"></a></p>
<div align=left><img src="chap1-Z-G-244.gif" border="0"></div>
<p>
which we recognize as the correct equation for the pendulum.  This is
the same as the Lagrange equation for the pendulum using the
unconstrained generalized coordinate <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-19.gif" border="0">.  For completeness, we
can find <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-40.gif" border="0"> in terms of the other variables:
<a name="EQUATION_1.197"></a></p>
<div align=left><img src="chap1-Z-G-245.gif" border="0"></div>
<p>
This confirms that <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-40.gif" border="0"> is really the composition of a function
of the state with the state path.  Notice that 2 <em>l</em> <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-40.gif" border="0"> is a
<a name="%_idx_1006"></a><a name="%_idx_1008"></a>force -- it is the sum of the outward component of the gravitational
force and the centrifugal force.  Using this interpretation in the two
coordinate equations of motion, we see that the terms involving
<img src="chap1-Z-G-D-40.gif" border="0"> are the forces that must be applied to the unconstrained
particle to make it move on the circle required by the constraints.
Equivalently, we may think of 2 <em>l</em> <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-40.gif" border="0"> as the tension in the
pendulum rod that holds the mass.<a name="call_footnote_Temp_162" href="#footnote_Temp_162"><sup><small>92</small></sup></a></p>

<h4><a href="book-Z-H-4.html#%_toc_%_sec_Temp_163">Building systems from parts</a></h4>
<p><a name="%_idx_1010"></a><a name="%_idx_1012"></a>The method of using augmented Lagrangians to enforce constraints on
dynamical systems provides a way to analyze a compound system by
combining the results of the analysis of the parts of the system and
the coupling between them.</p>
<p>
<a name="%_idx_1014"></a>Consider the compound spring-mass system shown at the top of
figure&nbsp;<a href="#FIGURE_1.9">1.9</a>.  We could analyze this as a monolithic
system with two configuration coordinates <em>x</em><sub>1</sub> and <em>x</em><sub>2</sub>,
representing the extensions of the springs from their equilibrium
lengths <em>X</em><sub>1</sub> and <em>X</em><sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>
An alternative procedure is to break the system into several parts.
In our spring-mass system we can choose two parts: one is a spring and
mass attached to the wall, and the other is a spring and mass with its
attachment point at an additional configuration coordinate <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-18.gif" border="0">.  We
can formulate a Lagrangian for each part separately.  We can then
choose a Lagrangian for the composite system as the sum of the two
component Lagrangians with a constraint <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-18.gif" border="0">  =  <em>X</em><sub>1</sub>  +  <em>x</em><sub>1</sub> to
accomplish the coupling.</p>
<p>
<a name="FIGURE_1.9"></a></p>
<div align=left><img src="chap1-Z-G-246.gif" border="0"></div>
<p></p>
<p>
Let's see how this works.
The Lagrangian for the subsystem attached to the wall is 
<a name="EQUATION_1.198"></a></p>
<div align=left><img src="chap1-Z-G-247.gif" border="0"></div>
<p>
and the Lagrangian for the subsystem that attaches to it is
<a name="EQUATION_1.199"></a></p>
<div align=left><img src="chap1-Z-G-248.gif" border="0"></div>
<p>
We construct a Lagrangian for the system composed from these parts as
a sum of the Lagrangians for each of the separate parts, with a
coupling term to enforce the constraint:
<a name="EQUATION_1.200"></a></p>
<div align=left><img src="chap1-Z-G-249.gif" border="0"></div>
<p>
Thus we can write Lagrange's equations for the four configuration
coordinates, in order, as follows:
<a name="EQUATION_1.201"></a></p>
<div align=left><img src="chap1-Z-G-250.gif" border="0"></div>
<p>
Notice that in this system <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-40.gif" border="0"> is the force of
constraint holding the system together.
We can now eliminate the ``glue'' coordinates <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-18.gif" border="0"> and
<img src="chap1-Z-G-D-40.gif" border="0"> to obtain the equations of
motion in the coordinates <em>x</em><sub>1</sub> and&nbsp;<em>x</em><sub>2</sub>:
<a name="EQUATION_1.205"></a></p>
<div align=left><img src="chap1-Z-G-251.gif" border="0"></div>
<p></p>
<p>
This strategy can be generalized.  We can make a library of primitive
components.  Each component may be characterized by a Lagrangian with
additional degrees of freedom for the <em>terminals</em> where that
component may be attached to others.  We then can construct composite
Lagrangians by combining components, using constraints to glue together
the terminals.</p>

<br><strong>a</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Make another primitive component, compatible with the
spring-mass structures described in this section.  For example, make a
pendulum that can attach to the spring-mass system.  Build a
combination and derive the equations of motion.  Be careful, the
algebra is horrible if you choose bad coordinates.</p>
<p>
<strong>b</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;For a nice little project, construct a family of compatible
mechanical parts, characterized by appropriate Lagrangians, that can
be combined in a variety of ways to make interesting mechanisms.
Remember that in a good language the result of combining pieces should

<div align=left><img src="chap1-Z-G-253.gif" border="0"></div>
<p>
Given a <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-56.gif" border="0"> we can find <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-16.gif" border="0"> by solving this linear partial

hand, if we knew <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-16.gif" border="0">  =  <em>K</em> then <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-56.gif" border="0">  =  0 follows.  Thus the

Lagrange equations for such systems.</p>
<p>
If <em>L</em> is a Lagrangian for the unconstrained problem, the Lagrange

The important feature is that we can write the Lagrange equations

<p>
<a name="%_idx_1024"></a><a name="%_idx_1026"></a>It turns out that the augmented Lagrangian trick also works here.
These Lagrange equations are given if we augment the Lagrangian with

Sometimes a problem can be naturally formulated in terms of
velocity-dependent constraints.  The formalism we have developed will
handle any velocity-dependent constraint that can be written in terms
of the derivative of a coordinate constraint.  Such a constraint is
called an <a name="%_idx_1028"></a><a name="%_idx_1030"></a><a name="%_idx_1032"></a><a name="%_idx_1034"></a><em>integrable constraint</em>.  Any system for which the

already in that form, is called a <em>holonomic system</em>.</p>

<h4><a href="book-Z-H-4.html#%_toc_%_sec_Temp_168">Goldstein's hoop</a></h4>
<p><a name="%_idx_1036"></a>Here we consider a problem for which the constraint can be represented
as a time derivative of a coordinate constraint: a
hoop of mass <em>M</em> rolling,
without slipping, down a (one-dimensional) inclined plane (see
figure&nbsp;<a href="#FIGURE_1.10">1.10</a>).<a name="call_footnote_Temp_169" href="#footnote_Temp_169"><sup><small>93</small></sup></a></p>
<p>
<a name="FIGURE_1.10"></a></p>
<div align=left><img src="chap1-Z-G-260.gif" border="0"></div>
<p></p>
<p>
We will formulate this problem in terms of the two
coordinates&nbsp;<img src="chap1-Z-G-D-19.gif" border="0">,
the rotation of an arbitrary point on the hoop from an
arbitrary reference direction, and <em>x</em>, the linear progress down the
inclined plane.  The constraint is that the hoop does not slip.
Thus a change in <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-19.gif" border="0"> is exactly reflected in a change in <em>x</em>;
the constraint function is
<a name="EQUATION_1.215"></a></p>
<div align=left><img src="chap1-Z-G-261.gif" border="0"></div>
<p>
This constraint is phrased as a relation among generalized velocities, but it
could be integrated to get <em>x</em>  =  <em>R</em> <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-19.gif" border="0">  +  <em>c</em>.  We may form our
augmented Lagrangian with either the integrated constraint or its
derivative.</p>
<p>
The kinetic energy has two parts, the energy of rotation of the hoop
and the energy of the motion of its center of mass.<a name="call_footnote_Temp_170" href="#footnote_Temp_170"><sup><small>94</small></sup></a>
The potential
energy of the hoop decreases as the height decreases.  Thus we may
write the augmented Lagrangian:
<a name="EQUATION_1.216"></a></p>
<div align=left><img src="chap1-Z-G-262.gif" border="0"></div>
<p>
Lagrange's equations are
<a name="EQUATION_1.217"></a></p>
<div align=left><img src="chap1-Z-G-263.gif" border="0"></div>
<p>
And by differentiation of the third Lagrange equation we obtain 
<a name="EQUATION_1.220"></a></p>
<div align=left><img src="chap1-Z-G-264.gif" border="0"></div>
<p></p>
<p>
By combining these equations we can solve for the
dynamical quantities of interest.  For this case of a rolling hoop the
linear acceleration
<a name="EQUATION_1.221"></a></p>
<div align=left><img src="chap1-Z-G-265.gif" border="0"></div>
<p>
is just half of what it would have been if the mass had just slid down
a frictionless plane without rotating.  Note that for this hoop <em>D</em><sup>2</sup><em>x</em>
is independent of both <em>M</em> and <em>R</em>.  
We see from the Lagrange equations
that <em>D</em><img src="chap1-Z-G-D-40.gif" border="0"> can be interpreted as the friction force involved
in enforcing the constraint.  The frictional force of constraint is
<a name="EQUATION_1.222"></a></p>

<h3><a href="book-Z-H-4.html#%_toc_%_sec_1.10.3">1.10.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonholonomic Systems</a></h3>
<p>
<a name="%_idx_1038"></a>
Systems with constraints that are not integrable are termed <em>nonholonomic systems</em>.  A constraint is not integrable if it cannot
be written in terms of an equivalent coordinate constraint.  An
example of a nonholonomic system is a ball rolling without slipping
in a bowl.  As the ball rolls it must turn so that its surface
does not move relative to the bowl at the point of contact.  This
looks as if it might establish a relation between the location of the
ball in the bowl and the orientation of the ball, but it doesn't.  The
ball may return to the same place in the bowl with different
orientations depending on the intervening path it has taken.  As
a consequence, the constraints cannot be used to eliminate any
coordinates.</p>
<p>
<a name="%_idx_1040"></a><a name="%_idx_1042"></a>What are the equations of motion governing nonholonomic systems?
For the restricted set of systems with nonholonomic
constraints that are linear in the velocities, it is widely 
reported<a name="call_footnote_Temp_171" href="#footnote_Temp_171"><sup><small>95</small></sup></a> 
that the equations of motion are as follows.  Let <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-56.gif" border="0"> have the form
<a name="EQUATION_1.224"></a></p>
<div align=left><img src="chap1-Z-G-268.gif" border="0"></div>
<p>
a state function that is linear in the velocities.  We assume <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-56.gif" border="0">
is not a total time derivative.  If <em>L</em> is a Lagrangian for the
unconstrained system, then the equations of motion are
asserted to be
<a name="EQUATION_1.225"></a></p>
<div align=left><img src="chap1-Z-G-269.gif" border="0"></div>
<p>
With the constraint <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-56.gif" border="0"> = 0, the system is closed and the
evolution of the system is determined.  Note that these equations are
identical to the Lagrange equations
(<a href="#EQUATION_1.212">1.212</a>) for the case that <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-56.gif" border="0"> is a
total time derivative, but here the derivation of those equations is
no longer valid.</p>
<p>
An essential step in the
derivation of the Lagrange equations for coordinate constraints <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-16.gif" border="0">
 =  0 with <img src="front-Z-G-D-2.gif" border="0"><sub>2</sub> <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-16.gif" border="0">  =  0 was to
note that two conditions must be satisfied:
<a name="EQUATION_1.226"></a></p>
<div align=left><img src="chap1-Z-G-270.gif" border="0"></div>
<p>
and
<a name="EQUATION_1.227"></a></p>
<div align=left><img src="chap1-Z-G-271.gif" border="0"></div>
<p>
Because  <em>E</em> [<em>L</em>] <small>o</small> <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-9.gif" border="0">[<em>q</em>] is orthogonal to <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-13.gif" border="0"> and <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-13.gif" border="0">
is constrained to be orthogonal to 
<img src="front-Z-G-D-2.gif" border="0"><sub>1</sub> <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-16.gif" border="0"> <small>o</small> <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-9.gif" border="0">[<em>q</em>] , the two must be parallel at
each moment:
<a name="EQUATION_1.228"></a></p>
<div align=left><img src="chap1-Z-G-272.gif" border="0"></div>
<p>
The Lagrange equations for derivative constraints
were derived from this.</p>
<p>
This derivation does not go through if the constraint function 
depends on velocity.  In this case, for a
variation <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-13.gif" border="0"> to be consistent with the velocity-dependent
constraint function <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-56.gif" border="0"> it must satisfy 
(see equation&nbsp;<a href="#1.179">1.179</a>)
<a name="EQUATION_1.229"></a></p>
<div align=left><img src="chap1-Z-G-273.gif" border="0"></div>
<p>
We may no longer eliminate <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-13.gif" border="0"> by the same argument, because <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-13.gif" border="0">
is no longer orthogonal to <img src="front-Z-G-D-2.gif" border="0"><sub>1</sub> <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-56.gif" border="0"> <small>o</small> <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-9.gif" border="0">[<em>q</em>], and we
cannot rewrite the constraint as a coordinate constraint because
<img src="chap1-Z-G-D-56.gif" border="0"> is, by assumption, not integrable.</p>
<p>
The following is the derivation of the nonholonomic equations from
Arnold et al.&nbsp;[<a href="book-Z-H-80.html#cite{Arnold88}">6</a>], translated into our notation.
Define a ``virtual velocity'' <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-18.gif" border="0"> to be any velocity satisfying
<a name="EQUATION_1.230"></a></p>
<div align=left><img src="chap1-Z-G-274.gif" border="0"></div>
<p>
<a name="%_idx_1044"></a><a name="%_idx_1046"></a><a name="%_idx_1048"></a>The ``principle of d'Alembert-Lagrange,'' according to Arnold, states that
<a name="EQUATION_1.231"></a></p>
<div align=left><img src="chap1-Z-G-275.gif" border="0"></div>
<p>
for any virtual velocity <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-18.gif" border="0">.  
Because <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-18.gif" border="0"> is arbitrary except that it is required to be orthogonal
to <img src="front-Z-G-D-2.gif" border="0"><sub>2</sub> <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-56.gif" border="0"> <small>o</small> <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-9.gif" border="0">[<em>q</em>] and any such <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-18.gif" border="0"> is orthogonal
to  <em>E</em> [<em>L</em>] <small>o</small> <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-9.gif" border="0">[<em>q</em>], then <img src="front-Z-G-D-2.gif" border="0"><sub>2</sub> <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-56.gif" border="0"> <small>o</small> <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-9.gif" border="0">[<em>q</em>]
must be parallel to  <em>E</em> [<em>L</em>] <small>o</small> <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-9.gif" border="0">[<em>q</em>].
So
<a name="EQUATION_1.232"></a></p>
<div align=left><img src="chap1-Z-G-276.gif" border="0"></div>
<p>
which are the nonholonomic equations.</p>
<p>

To convert the stationary action equations to the equations of Arnold
we must do the following.  To get from
equation&nbsp;(<a href="#EQUATION_1.226">1.226</a>) to
equation&nbsp;(<a href="#EQUATION_1.231">1.231</a>), we must replace <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-13.gif" border="0"> by
<img src="chap1-Z-G-D-18.gif" border="0">.  However, to get from equation&nbsp;(<a href="#EQUATION_1.229">1.229</a>) to
equation&nbsp;(<a href="#EQUATION_1.230">1.230</a>), we must set <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-13.gif" border="0">  =  0 and
replace <em>D</em><img src="chap1-Z-G-D-13.gif" border="0"> by <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-18.gif" border="0">.  All ``derivations'' of the nonholonomic
equations have similar identifications.  It comes down to this: the
nonholonomic equations do not follow from the action principle.  They
are something else.  Whether they are correct or not depends on
whether or not they agree with experiment.</p>
<p>
For systems with either coordinate constraints or derivative constraints, we
have found that the Lagrange equations can be derived from a
Lagrangian that is augmented with the constraint.  However, if the
constraints are not integrable the Lagrange equations for the
augmented Lagrangian are not the same as the nonholonomic
system&nbsp;(equations&nbsp;<a href="#EQUATION_1.225">1.225</a>).<a name="call_footnote_Temp_172" href="#footnote_Temp_172"><sup><small>96</small></sup></a>
Let <em>L</em>' be an augmented Lagrangian with non-integrable constraint <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-56.gif" border="0">:
<a name="EQUATION_1.233"></a></p>
<div align=left><img src="chap1-Z-G-277.gif" border="0"></div>
<p>
then the Lagrange equations associated with the coordinates are
<a name="EQUATION_1.234"></a></p>
<div align=left><img src="chap1-Z-G-278.gif" border="0"></div>
<p>
The Lagrange equation associated with <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-40.gif" border="0"> is just the constraint equation
<a name="EQUATION_1.235"></a></p>
<div align=left><img src="chap1-Z-G-279.gif" border="0"></div>
<p>
An interesting feature of these equations is that 
they
involve both <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-40.gif" border="0"> and <em>D</em><img src="chap1-Z-G-D-40.gif" border="0">.  Thus the usual state
variables <em>q</em> and <em>D</em><em>q</em>, with the constraint, are not sufficient
to determine a full set of initial conditions for the derived Lagrange
equations; we need to specify an initial value for <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-40.gif" border="0"> as well.</p>
<p>
In general, for any particular physical system,
equations&nbsp;(<a href="#EQUATION_1.225">1.225</a>) and (<a href="#EQUATION_1.234">1.234</a>)
are not the same, and in fact they have different solutions.  It is
not apparent that either set of equations accurately models the
physical system.  The first approach to nonholonomic systems is not
justified by extension of the arguments for the holonomic case and the
other is not fully determined.  Perhaps this indicates that the
models are inadequate, that more details of how the constraints are
maintained need to be specified.</p>
