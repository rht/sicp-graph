<p>
The motion of rigid bodies presents many surprising phenomena.</p>
<p>
<a name="%_idx_1056"></a><a name="%_idx_1058"></a>Consider the motion of a top.  A top is usually thought of as an
axisymmetric body, subject to gravity, with a point on the axis of
symmetry that is fixed in space.  The top is spun and in general
executes some complicated motion.  We observe that the top usually
settles down into an unusual motion in which the axis of the top
slowly <a name="%_idx_1060"></a>precesses about the vertical, apparently moving perpendicular
to the direction in which gravity is attempting to accelerate it.</p>
<p>
<a name="%_idx_1062"></a>Consider the motion of a book thrown into the air.<a name="call_footnote_Temp_175" href="#footnote_Temp_175"><sup><small>1</small></sup></a>  Books have
three main axes.  If we idealize a book as a brick with rectangular faces, the
three axes are the lines through the centers of opposite faces.  Try
spinning the book about each axis.  The motion of the book spun about
the longest and the shortest axis is a simple regular rotation,
perhaps with a little wobble depending on how carefully it is thrown.
The motion of the book spun about the intermediate axis is
qualitatively different: however carefully the book is spun about
the intermediate axis, it tumbles.</p>
<p>
<a name="%_idx_1066"></a><a name="%_idx_1068"></a>The rotation of the Moon is peculiar in that the Moon always presents
the same face to the Earth, indicating that the rotational period and
the orbit period are the same.  Considering that the orbit of the Moon
is constantly changing because of interactions with the Sun and other
planets, and therefore its orbital period is constantly
undergoing small variations, we might expect that the face of the Moon
that we see would slowly change, but it does not.  What is special
about the face that is presented to us?</p>
<p>
<a name="%_idx_1070"></a>A rigid body may be thought of as a large number of constituent
particles with rigid constraints among them.  Thus the dynamical
principles governing the motion of rigid bodies are the same as those
governing the motion of any other system of particles with rigid
constraints.  What is new here is that the number of constituent
particles is very large and we need to develop new tools to handle
them effectively.</p>
<p>
We have found that a Lagrangian for a system with rigid constraints
can be written as the difference of the kinetic and potential
energies.  The kinetic and potential energies are naturally expressed
in terms of the positions and velocities of the constituent particles.
To write the Lagrangian in terms of the generalized coordinates and
velocities we must specify functions that relate the generalized
coordinates to the positions of the constituent particles.  In the
systems with rigid constraints considered up to now these functions
were explicitly given for each of the constituent particles and
individually included in the derivation of the Lagrangian.  For a
rigid body, however, there are too many consituent particles to handle each one
of them in this way.  We need to find means of expressing the kinetic
and potential energies of rigid bodies in terms of the generalized
coordinates and velocities, without going through the
particle-by-particle details.</p>
<p>
The strategy is to first rewrite the kinetic and potential energies in
terms of quantities that characterize essential aspects of the
distribution of mass in the body and the state of motion of the body.
Only later do we introduce generalized coordinates.  For the kinetic
energy, it turns out a small number of parameters completely specify
the state of motion and the relevant aspects of the distribution of
mass in the body.  For the potential energy, we find that for some
specific problems the potential energy can be represented with a small
number of parameters, but in general we have to make approximations to
obtain a representation with a manageable number of parameters.</p>
