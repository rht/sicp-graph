<h2><a href="book-Z-H-4.html#%_toc_%_sec_4.3">4.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Homoclinic Tangle</a></h2>
<p><a name="%_idx_2250"></a>
For the driven pendulum we observe that as the amplitude of the drive
is increased the separatrix of the undriven pendulum is where the most
prominent chaotic zone appears.  Here we examine in great detail the motion in the
<a name="%_idx_2252"></a>vicinity of the separatrix.
What emerges is a remarkably complicated picture, first discovered by
<a name="%_idx_2254"></a>Henri Poincar&eacute;.  Indeed, Poincar&eacute; stated
(see the epigraph to this chapter) that the picture that
emerged was so complicated that he was not even going to attempt to
draw it.  We will review the argument leading to the picture, and
compute enough of it to convince ourselves of its reality.</p>
<p>
The separatrix of the undriven pendulum is made up of two trajectories
that are <a name="%_idx_2256"></a><a name="%_idx_2258"></a>asymptotic to the unstable equilibrium.  In the driven
pendulum with zero drive, an infinite number of distinct
orbits lie on the separatrix; they are distinguished by the
phase of the drive.  These orbits are asymptotic to the unstable fixed
point both forward and backward in time.</p>
<p>
<a name="FIGURE_4.6"></a></p>
<div align=left><img src="chap4-Z-G-40.gif" border="0"></div>
<p></p>
<p>
Notice that close to the unstable fixed point the sets of points that
are asymptotic to the unstable equilibrium must be tangent to the
linear variational <a name="%_idx_2260"></a>eigenvectors at the fixed point.  (See
figure&nbsp;<a href="#FIGURE_4.6">4.6</a>.)  In a sense, the sets of orbits that
are asymptotic to the fixed point are extensions to the nonlinear
problem of the sets of orbits that are asymptotic to the fixed point
in the linearized problem.</p>
<p>
The set of points that are asymptotic to an unstable fixed
point forward in time is called the <a name="%_idx_2262"></a><a name="%_idx_2264"></a><a name="%_idx_2266"></a><em>stable manifold</em> of the fixed
point.  The set of points that are asymptotic to an unstable fixed
<a name="%_idx_2268"></a>point backward in time is called the <em>unstable manifold</em>.  For the
driven pendulum with zero-amplitude drive, all points on the separatrix
are asymptotic both forward and backward in time to the unstable fixed
point. So in this case the stable and unstable manifolds coincide.</p>
<p>
If the drive amplitude is nonzero then there are still
one-dimensional sets of points that are asymptotic to the unstable
fixed point forward and backward in time: there are still stable and
unstable manifolds.  Why?  The behavior near the fixed point is
described by the linearized variational system.  For the linear
variational system, points in the space spanned by the unstable
eigenvector, when mapped backwards in time, are asymptotic to the
fixed point.  Points slightly off this curve may initially approach
the unstable equilibrium, but eventually will fall away to one side or
the other.  For the driven system with small drive, there must still
be a curve that separates the points that fall away to one side from
the points that fall away to the other side.  Points on the dividing
curve must be asymptotic to the unstable equilibrium.  The dividing
set cannot have positive area because the map is area preserving.</p>
<p>
For the zero-amplitude drive case, the stable and unstable manifolds
are contours of the conserved Hamiltonian.  For nonzero amplitude the
Hamiltonian is no longer conserved, and the stable
manifolds and unstable manifolds no longer coincide.  This is
generally true for non-integrable systems: stable and unstable
manifolds do not coincide.</p>
<p>
<a name="FIGURE_4.7"></a></p>
<div align=left><img src="chap4-Z-G-41.gif" border="0"></div>
<p></p>
<p>
If the stable and unstable manifolds no longer coincide, where do they
go?  In general, the stable and unstable manifolds must cross one
another.  The only other possibilities are that they run off to
infinity or spiral around.  Area preservation can be used to exclude
the spiraling case.  We will see that in general there are barriers to
running away.  So the only possibility is that the stable and unstable
manifolds cross, as is illustrated in
figure&nbsp;<a href="#FIGURE_4.7">4.7</a>.  The point of crossing of
a stable and unstable manifold is called a <a name="%_idx_2270"></a><em>homoclinic
intersection</em> if the stable and unstable manifolds belong to the same
unstable fixed point.  It is called a <a name="%_idx_2272"></a><em>heteroclinic intersection</em>
if the stable and unstable manifolds belong to different fixed points.</p>
<p>
If the stable and unstable manifolds cross once then there are an
infinite number of other crossings.  The intersection point belongs to
both the stable and unstable manifolds.  That it is on the unstable
manifold means that all images forward and backward in time also belong to
the unstable manifold, and likewise for points on the stable manifold.
Thus all images of the intersection belong to both the stable and
unstable manifolds.  So these images must be additional crossings of
the two manifolds.  </p>
<p>
We can deduce that there are still more intersections of the stable
and unstable manifolds.  The maps we are considering not only preserve
area but also orientation.  In the proof of Liouville's
theorem we showed that the determinant of the transformation is one,
not just magnitude one.  If we consider little segments of the stable
and unstable manifolds near the intersection point, then these segments
must map near the image of the intersection point.  That the map
preserves orientation implies that the manifolds are crossing one
another in the same sense as at the previous intersection.  Therefore
there must have been at least one more crossing of the stable and
unstable manifolds in between these two.  This is illustrated in
figure&nbsp;<a href="#FIGURE_4.8">4.8</a>.  Of course, all forward and
backward images of these intermediate intersections are also
intersections.</p>
<p>
<a name="FIGURE_4.8"></a></p>
<div align=left><img src="chap4-Z-G-42.gif" border="0"></div>
<p></p>
<p>
As the picture gets more complicated, keep in mind that the stable
manifold cannot cross itself and the unstable manifold cannot cross
itself.  Suppose one did, say by making a little loop.  The image of
this loop under the map must also be a loop.  So if there were a loop
there would have to be an infinite number of loops.  That would be okay,
but what happens as the loop gets close to the fixed point?  There
would still have to be loops, but then the stable and unstable
manifolds would not have the right behavior:  the stable and unstable
manifolds of the linearized map do not have loops.  Therefore, the
stable and unstable manifolds cannot cross themselves.<a name="call_footnote_Temp_309" href="#footnote_Temp_309"><sup><small>7</small></sup></a></p>
<p>
We are not done yet!  The lobes that are defined by successive
crossings of the stable and unstable manifolds enclose a certain area.
The map is area preserving so all images of these lobes must have the
same area.  As the lobes approach the fixed point, we get
an infinite number of lobes with a base of exponentially shrinking
length.  The stable and unstable manifolds cannot cross themselves, so
to pack these lobes together on the plane the lobes must stretch out
to preserve area.  We see that the length of the lobe must grow
roughly exponentially (it may not be uniform in width so it need not
be exactly exponential).  This exponential lengthening of the lobes no
doubt bears some responsibility for the <a name="%_idx_2274"></a><a name="%_idx_2276"></a>exponential divergence of
nearby trajectories of <a name="%_idx_2278"></a><a name="%_idx_2280"></a>chaotic orbits, but does not prove it.  It
does, however, suggest a connection between the fact that chaotic
orbits appear to occupy an area on the section and the fact that
nearby chaotic orbits diverge exponentially.</p>
<p>
Actually, the situation is even more complicated.  As the lobes
stretch, they form tendrils that wrap around the separatrix region.
The tendrils of the unstable manifold can cross the tendrils of the
stable manifold.  Each point of crossing is a new homoclinic
intersection, and so each pre- and post-image of this point belongs to
both the stable and unstable manifolds, indicating another crossing of
these curves.  We could go on and on.  No wonder Poincar&eacute; refused to
draw this mess.</p>

<b>Exercise 4.5.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Homoclinic paradox</strong><br></p>
<p>
How do we fit an infinite number of copies of a finite area in a
finite region, without allowing the stable and unstable manifolds to
cross themselves?  Resolve this apparent paradox.</p>

<h3><a href="book-Z-H-4.html#%_toc_%_sec_4.3.1">4.3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Computation of Stable and Unstable Manifolds</a></h3>
<p><a name="%_idx_2282"></a><a name="%_idx_2284"></a><a name="%_idx_2286"></a>
The homoclinic tangle is not just a bad dream.  We can actually
compute it.</p>
<p>
Very close to an unstable fixed point the stable and unstable
manifolds become indistinguishable from the rays along the
eigenvectors of the linearized system.  So one way to compute the
unstable manifold is to take a line of initial conditions close to the
fixed point along the unstable manifold of the linearized system and
evolve them forward in time.  Similarly, the stable manifold can be
constructed by taking a line of initial conditions along the stable
manifold of the linearized system and evolving them backward in time.</p>
<p>
We can do better than this by choosing some parameter (like arc length)
along the manifold and for each parameter deciding how many iterations
of the map would be required to take the point back to within some
small region of the fixed point.  We then choose an initial condition
along the linearized eigenvectors and iterate the point back with the
map.  This idea is implemented in the following program:
</p>
<p><tt>(define&nbsp;((unstable-manifold&nbsp;T&nbsp;xe&nbsp;ye&nbsp;dx&nbsp;dy&nbsp;rho&nbsp;eps)&nbsp;param)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(let&nbsp;((n&nbsp;(floor-&gt;exact&nbsp;(/&nbsp;(log&nbsp;(/&nbsp;param&nbsp;eps))&nbsp;(log&nbsp;rho)))))<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;((iterated-map&nbsp;T&nbsp;n)&nbsp;(+&nbsp;xe&nbsp;(*&nbsp;dx&nbsp;(/&nbsp;param&nbsp;(expt&nbsp;rho&nbsp;n))))<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(+&nbsp;ye&nbsp;(*&nbsp;dy&nbsp;(/&nbsp;param&nbsp;(expt&nbsp;rho&nbsp;n))))<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cons<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(lambda&nbsp;()&nbsp;(error&nbsp;&quot;Failed&quot;)))))<br>
</p>
</tt>
<p>where <tt>T</tt> is the map, <tt>xe</tt> and <tt>ye</tt> are the coordinates
of the fixed point, <tt>dx</tt> and <tt>dy</tt> are components of the
linearized eigenvector, <tt>rho</tt> is the characteristic multiplier,
<tt>eps</tt> is a scale within which the linearized map is a good enough
approximation to <tt>T</tt>, and <tt>param</tt> is a continuous parameter
along the manifold.  The program assumes that there is a basic
exponential divergence along the manifold -- that is why we take the
logarithm of <tt>param</tt> to get initial conditions in the linear
regime.  This assumption is not exactly true, but it is good enough for now.</p>
<p>
The curve is generated by a call to <tt>plot-parametric-fill</tt>,
which recursively subdivides intervals of the parameter until there
are enough points to get a smooth curve.
</p>
<p><tt><a name="%_idx_2288"></a>(define&nbsp;(plot-parametric-fill&nbsp;win&nbsp;f&nbsp;a&nbsp;b&nbsp;near?)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(let&nbsp;loop&nbsp;((a&nbsp;a)&nbsp;(xa&nbsp;(f&nbsp;a))&nbsp;(b&nbsp;b)&nbsp;(xb&nbsp;(f&nbsp;b)))<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(if&nbsp;(not&nbsp;(close-enuf?&nbsp;a&nbsp;b&nbsp;(*&nbsp;10&nbsp;*machine-epsilon*)))<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(let&nbsp;((m&nbsp;(/&nbsp;(+&nbsp;a&nbsp;b)&nbsp;2)))<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(let&nbsp;((xm&nbsp;(f&nbsp;m)))<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(plot-point&nbsp;win&nbsp;(car&nbsp;xm)&nbsp;(cdr&nbsp;xm))<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(if&nbsp;(not&nbsp;(near?&nbsp;xa&nbsp;xm))<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(loop&nbsp;a&nbsp;xa&nbsp;m&nbsp;xm))<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(if&nbsp;(not&nbsp;(near?&nbsp;xb&nbsp;xm))<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(loop&nbsp;m&nbsp;xm&nbsp;b&nbsp;xb)))))))<br>
</p>
</tt>
<p>The <tt>near?</tt> argument is a test for whether two points are within
a given distance of each other in the graph.  Because some coordinates
are angle variables, this may involve a principal value comparison.
For example, for the driven pendulum section, the horizontal axis is
an angle but the vertical axis is not, so the picture is on a
cylinder:
</p>
<p><tt>(define&nbsp;(cylinder-near?&nbsp;eps)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(let&nbsp;((eps2&nbsp;(square&nbsp;eps)))<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(lambda&nbsp;(x&nbsp;y)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(&lt;&nbsp;(+&nbsp;(square&nbsp;((principal-value&nbsp;pi)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(-&nbsp;(car&nbsp;x)&nbsp;(car&nbsp;y))))<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(square&nbsp;(-&nbsp;(cdr&nbsp;x)&nbsp;(cdr&nbsp;y))))<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eps2))))<br>
</p>

<p><a name="footnote_Temp_309" href="#call_footnote_Temp_309"><sup><small>7</small></sup></a> Sometimes it is argued that the stable and unstable
manifolds cannot cross themselves on the basis of the uniqueness of
solutions of differential equations.  This argument is incorrect.  
The stable and unstable manifolds are not themselves solutions of a 
differential equation, they are sets of points whose solutions are 
asymptotic to the unstable fixed points.</p>
